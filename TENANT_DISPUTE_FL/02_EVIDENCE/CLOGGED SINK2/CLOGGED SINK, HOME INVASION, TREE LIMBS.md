# **Failure to Maintain a Habitable Property**

Under **Fla. Stat. §83.51(1)**, landlords are required to ensure properties meet all building, housing, and health codes. Key incidents during my tenancy include:

-   **January 2024:** A severely clogged kitchen sink rendered the property unsanitary for 15 days. You failed to arrange repairs, forcing me to handle the issue independently.
    
-   **March 2024:** Faulty motion lights and deteriorated gates facilitated a violent home invasion. Despite acknowledging these safety concerns, you took no action to address them.
    
-   **April 2024:** Overhanging tree limbs above outdoor electrical cables created hazardous conditions. Neglected vegetation, including bamboo, an alleged jackfruit tree, and other trees, added to safety risks.

Each incident is detailed below.





### **January 2024: Failure to Address Critical Maintenance (Clogged Kitchen Sink)**

**Incident:**  
In **January 2024**, I reported a **severely clogged kitchen sink** that rendered one side of the sink unusable. Water stagnated for **15 consecutive days**, creating unsanitary and potentially hazardous living conditions. Despite my clear communications outlining the issue and requesting timely resolution, you failed to respond or take action to address the problem. Ultimately, after over two weeks of inaction, I was left with no choice but to resolve the issue independently at my own expense.

* * *

**Impact and Precedent Set:**  
Your complete lack of response and failure to fulfill your legal obligation to maintain the property set a **clear precedent** for how all future maintenance, sanitary, and safety concerns would be handled—or, rather, neglected—by you as the landlord. As a tenant living in **Florida** while you remained out of state in **North Carolina**, your geographic absence, combined with delays in communication (or outright silence), indicated to me that **immediate and urgent concerns** requiring action would have to be resolved **entirely by me** in order to ensure my basic health, safety, and habitability.

This incident signaled a lack of support and responsiveness, forcing me to accept that any similar emergencies—whether sanitary hazards, maintenance failures, or security breaches—would likely be **ignored** or delayed to the point where I would be required to handle them myself, regardless of cost, burden, or legal obligation.

* * *

**Statutory Basis:**

*   **Fla. Stat. § 83.51(2)(a):**  
    "The landlord shall make reasonable provisions for \[...\] running water and hot water."
*   **Fla. Stat. § 83.51(1)(b):**  
    "The landlord shall maintain the plumbing in reasonable working condition."

* * *

**Violation:**  
You violated your statutory duty to maintain essential plumbing facilities in functional condition, leaving me without a sanitary kitchen sink for over **15 days**. This failure was not an isolated lapse but an early indication that tenant needs—no matter how urgent—would be neglected unless handled directly by me.

* * *

**Supporting Evidence:**

*   Text messages documenting my notification of the clogged sink and your lack of response.
*   Follow-up text confirming I completed the repair independently due to your inaction.

* * *

**Conclusion:**  
The January 2024 sink incident exposed the **systemic inadequacy** of your responsiveness as an out-of-state landlord and set a troubling expectation: that any immediate or urgent safety, sanitary, or maintenance issue would be my responsibility, despite Florida law clearly placing this burden on the landlord. The failure to take corrective action, combined with the geographic disconnect, left me to live under the assumption that your neglect was a **requirement of living in your property**, as further evidenced by subsequent failures to address far more serious safety and habitability concerns later in the tenancy.

This incident laid the foundation for the recurring pattern of neglect and delayed communication that would continue to compromise my well-being and safety throughout the lease term.

**Tenant’s Prompt Communication:**  
I promptly reported the issue to you, clearly describing the problem and requesting guidance or repairs. Despite this, you failed to respond or arrange for any professional intervention to address the issue. Instead, I was left without a functioning sink for over two weeks.

**Tenant’s Self-Resolution:**  
After receiving no assistance or acknowledgment of my requests, I was forced to resolve the issue independently by purchasing tools and de-clogging solutions to clear the blockage. Following the repair, I documented my actions and informed you of the resolution via text message. However, there was no response or offer of reimbursement for my time and expenses.

**Pattern of Neglect:**  
This incident set a precedent for how maintenance and safety concerns would be handled during my tenancy. Your delayed responses—or complete lack thereof—indicated that immediate or urgent matters, regardless of their impact on health or habitability, would not receive the necessary support or attention from you. As a result, I was forced to anticipate and address such issues on my own to maintain a basic standard of living in the property.

**Violation of Florida Law:**  
Under **Fla. Stat. §83.51(2)(a)**, you are required to maintain essential facilities, such as plumbing, in working order. By neglecting to respond to a critical issue like this, you violated your statutory obligation to ensure that the property remained habitable and in compliance with health standards. This neglect further demonstrated a disregard for your duty as a landlord to support the tenant’s basic living needs and provide a safe and functional living environment.



### **March 2024: Home Invasion Enabled by Faulty Motion Lights and Deteriorating Gates**

**Incident:**  
On **March 26, 2024**, a **violent home invasion** occurred at approximately 3:00 A.M., facilitated by **deteriorating wooden gates** that could not lock, latch, or close properly, along with **faulty outdoor motion lights** that failed to activate and provide an alert. This terrifying incident required police intervention, culminating in the arrest of the intruder—a man with a documented history of **40 prior arrests, including 9 felonies**.

I immediately notified you of the break-in, provided photographic and police report evidence, and explicitly detailed the critical safety deficiencies that allowed the event to occur. Specifically, I requested:

-   **Repairs or replacement of the wooden side gates** with secure, metal locking gates.
-   **Repairs to faulty motion lights**, which failed to function reliably.

While you verbally acknowledged the deteriorating state of the gates and their need for replacement, you took no action to address these safety failures. Instead, you merely authorized me to install security cameras **at my own expense** under the condition that no drilling into the property would occur. This response was wholly inadequate and failed to meet the safety requirements demanded by law.

***

**Statutory Basis:**

-   **Fla. Stat. § 83.51(1)(a):**  
    "The landlord at all times during the tenancy shall:  
    (a) Comply with the requirements of applicable building, housing, and health codes."
-   **Fla. Stat. § 83.51(2)(a):**  
    "The landlord shall make reasonable provisions for locks and keys."

***

**Violation:**  
Your refusal to address critical safety hazards—gates incapable of locking and faulty motion lights—violated your statutory duty to provide a secure, habitable property. The failure to act after a documented **life-threatening incident**constitutes a reckless disregard for tenant safety.

***f

**Impact on Tenant:**

-   **Physical and Psychological Trauma**: The break-in caused immense fear, exacerbating my **documented PTSD**and leaving me and my family feeling unsafe in the home.
-   **Financial Burden**: I was forced to invest in self-funded security measures (e.g., cameras) to compensate for your neglect of basic safety obligations.
-   **Continued Fear and Anxiety**: Knowing the intruder was familiar with the property and its vulnerabilities heightened my distress. Your failure to act perpetuated an environment of ongoing insecurity.

***

**Supporting Evidence:**

-   Text messages notifying you of the break-in and requesting security improvements.
-   Photos and videos documenting the deteriorating gates and faulty motion lights.
-   Police report detailing the incident and arrest of the intruder.
-   Communications in which you acknowledged the unsafe condition of the gates and motion lights but failed to implement repairs.

***

**Conclusion:**  
The violent home invasion and your subsequent refusal to address safety concerns represent gross negligence and a violation of **Fla. Stat. § 83.51**. You acknowledged the property’s vulnerabilities but deliberately chose to place the financial burden for security improvements on me, the tenant. Your inaction exacerbated the trauma caused by the incident and directly contributed to my emotional distress and financial loss. This incident, coupled with your prior failure to address maintenance concerns, demonstrates a **pattern of willful neglect** and disregard for your legal duties under Florida law.




### **April 2024: Landlord’s On-Site Visit and Continued Neglect of Safety Issues**


April 2024: Neglected Tree Maintenance and Immediate Safety Risks  

During an **April 2024** onsite visit to the property, you, the landlord, physically observed critical safety concerns yet took no action to address them. These included:


-   **Deteriorated Side Gate Entrance:** The side gate, with no working latch or locks and visibly deteriorating wood, presented a clear security risk. You acknowledged the gate’s condition but did not take steps to repair or secure it.
    
-   **Faulty Motion Lights:** I showed you the non-functional motion lights during your visit, highlighting their failure to provide consistent or reliable illumination. These lights, critical for detecting motion and ensuring safety after the March 2024 home invasion, contributed more to distress with their erratic flickering than to security.

**Follow-Up Documentation:**  
Following your visit, I reintroduced the issue of the faulty motion lights via text message and provided a video recording to demonstrate their erratic behavior. Despite this, you failed to respond or take action, ignoring requests to revisit these critical safety concerns and explore your previous mention of installing metal gates to enhance property security.

-   **Sagging Tree Limbs:** Overhanging branches posed a hazard by hanging dangerously close to outdoor electrical cables above the primary outdoor area.
-   These claims fail to acknowledge the safety concerns that required prompt action. Moreover, by the time the tenant proceeded to trim the dangerously overhanging branches of the neglected tree, they had already experienced a lack of responsiveness from an out-of-state landlord regarding prior safety requests.
-   The landlord did not respond to the tenant's maintenance request nor take any action to improve safety measures following the violent home invasion that occurred on March 26, 2024.
-   The landlord did not address or even acknowledge the maintenance request submitted by the tenant in January 2024 regarding a clogged sink, which also went unanswered.
-   The allegations made by the landlord in the "Claims on Security" letter dated October 1, 2024, concerning the "cutting of limbs" of the "Jackfruit Tree" are baseless. 
    

**Pattern of Neglect:**  
Your failure to address these longstanding safety hazards—despite being physically present on-site, personally observing the issues, and receiving follow-up documentation—exemplifies an ongoing pattern of disregard for tenant safety. This inaction came just weeks after the March 2024 home invasion, further compounding the tenant’s distress and insecurity. Your unwillingness to act directly contravenes your statutory obligations under **Fla. Stat. §83.51**, which require landlords to maintain structural components in good repair and ensure the safety of the property.
