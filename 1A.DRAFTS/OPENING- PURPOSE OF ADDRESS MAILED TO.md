This correspondence serves as a definitive notice addressing your egregious noncompliance with Florida landlord-tenant statutes, as demonstrated during my tenancy at 2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL 33711. Your consistent pattern of negligence, bad faith, and deliberate obfuscation of your responsibilities has left me no choice but to pursue this matter more forcefully. The following serves as both a formal demand and a record of your statutory violations, which I will escalate through legal and regulatory channels should you fail to rectify these issues immediately.

  

**Opening Statement and Justification for Addressing Amarlu Enterprises**

  

This letter is directed to **Amarlu Enterprises**, listed at **420 181A Ave Lane NW, Hickory, NC 28601**, the address explicitly linked to your business entity in the **Assumed Business Name Certificate filed on July 7, 2024, in Catawba County, North Carolina.** Your use of Amarlu Enterprises for property-related dealings, including the management of this disputed lease, obligates this entity to serve as the appropriate contact for addressing these matters. My reliance on this address reflects both necessity and prudence, as your repeated failures to provide accurate contact information have left me with no other reliable means of communication.

  

**Why Amarlu Enterprises Is the Correct Point of Contact**

1. **Deliberate Obfuscation Through Inconsistent Addresses:**

• The lease agreement absurdly listed **2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL 33711**—the property being rented—as the “landlord address.” This designation is nonsensical, inappropriate, and a violation of **Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a)**, which requires landlords to provide valid, functional contact information for legal and financial correspondence.

• You later introduced additional addresses, including a **PO Box associated with Amarlu Enterprises**, further complicating the dispute resolution process. This inconsistency demonstrates a deliberate effort to frustrate communication and evade accountability.

2. **Public Filings Confirm Amarlu Enterprises’ Role:**

• Your public filings in North Carolina explicitly connect **Amarlu Enterprises** to your business dealings. By using Amarlu Enterprises to collect rent and manage property matters while failing to disclose this entity in the lease or register it as a foreign entity in Florida, you violated **Fla. Stat. §605.0902**, which requires out-of-state entities to register before conducting business in Florida.

3. **Obligation to Provide Accurate Contact Information:**

• Florida law mandates that landlords provide reliable contact details to tenants for dispute resolution and correspondence. Your failure to disclose Amarlu Enterprises or provide a consistent address reflects blatant disregard for these requirements, further evidencing bad faith in your handling of this lease.

4. **Tenant’s Good Faith Efforts vs. Landlord’s Bad Faith Practices:**

• While you repeatedly failed to provide consistent and accurate addresses, I took extraordinary measures to ensure proper delivery of correspondence, including:

• Retaining certified mail receipts and USPS tracking data documenting delays caused by the incorrect address you initially provided.

• Sending correspondence to all known addresses, including the PO Box belatedly introduced and the publicly available address for Amarlu Enterprises.

  

**Use of the Rental Property Address as the “Landlord Address” in the Lease**

  

Your lease agreement designated the same address as the rental property itself—**2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL 33711**—as the landlord address. This decision was not only nonsensical but also obstructive, further undermining your compliance with Florida law.

1. **Implications of Listing the Rental Property as the Landlord Address:**

• By failing to provide a separate and functional address, you obstructed the legally required communication process during and after the tenancy.

• Using the rented property as the landlord address is fundamentally flawed, as it is clear that you do not reside or conduct your business from that location.

2. **Failure to Provide a Legitimate Contact Address:**

• Florida law requires landlords to provide accurate contact information for dispute resolution and compliance with statutory notice requirements. By failing to provide any address distinct from the rental property, you rendered the lease’s contact information useless for official communications.

3. **Inconsistencies in Later Correspondence:**

• After designating the rental property as your contact address, you later directed me to use a PO Box associated with Amarlu Enterprises. This inconsistency highlights the inadequacy of your original instructions and further demonstrates your broader pattern of evasion.

4. **Impact on the Tenant:**

• The lack of a valid landlord address created unnecessary obstacles to resolving disputes and complying with statutory deadlines.

• Combined with your repeated use of incorrect or incomplete addresses, this failure demonstrates negligence and bad faith in managing the landlord-tenant relationship.

  

**Legal Violations and Implications of Your Conduct**

1. **Failure to Comply with Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a):**

• This statute requires landlords to provide clear and timely notice, including accurate contact information, to tenants. Your reliance on an invalid address, compounded by subsequent inconsistencies, is a clear violation.

2. **Violation of Fla. Stat. §605.0902:**

• By failing to register Amarlu Enterprises as a foreign entity in Florida, despite using it to collect rent and manage property dealings, you have evaded your legal obligations and undermined the enforceability of the lease agreement.

3. **Pattern of Negligence and Bad Faith:**

• The 10-day delay caused by the incorrect address you provided demonstrates negligence, while your subsequent use of a PO Box associated with Amarlu Enterprises underscores your inconsistent and obstructive practices.

4. **Failure to Maintain Open Channels of Communication (Fla. Stat. §83.51(2)(a)):**

• As a landlord, you are required to maintain effective communication with tenants to address maintenance and other concerns. Your failure to provide consistent and accurate addresses violated this duty.

  

**Consequences of Your Ongoing Noncompliance**

  

If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will escalate this dispute through all available legal and regulatory channels, including:

1. **Regulatory Complaints:**

• Filing formal complaints with Florida regulatory authorities, including the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, for violations of landlord-tenant statutes.

• Reporting to the Florida Department of Revenue and Internal Revenue Service for potential tax implications arising from your undisclosed business operations.

2. **Civil Litigation:**

• Pursuing legal action to recover:

• Full restitution of the $4,500 security deposit.

• Additional damages for bad faith, emotional distress, and financial losses caused by your negligent and obstructive practices.

3. **Public and Legal Accountability:**

• Highlighting your statutory violations and bad faith conduct in public and legal forums to ensure full accountability.

  

**Conclusion**

  

Your actions throughout this tenancy—from failing to provide a valid landlord address to relying on inconsistent and obstructive communication practices—demonstrate a willful disregard for your obligations under Florida law. My reliance on the publicly filed address for Amarlu Enterprises is not only justified but necessary, given your deliberate attempts to obscure your contact details and evade accountability.

  

This letter serves as your final opportunity to engage in good faith and resolve this matter amicably. Should you fail to act in accordance with Florida law, I will pursue every available remedy to ensure you are held accountable for your violations.
