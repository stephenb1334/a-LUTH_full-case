Under the existing regulations of the City of Gulfport, Pinellas County, Florida, applicable explicitly to the property at 2649 Tifton Street S, Gulfport, FL 33711, the installation or replacement of any fence or gate on residential property, including fences under six feet in height, requires an official building permit issued by the city government. This requirement stands independent of Pinellas County ordinances, which provide certain exemptions for fences measuring six feet or less located in unincorporated areas. Because the property located at 2649 Tifton Street S is within the incorporated jurisdiction of the City of Gulfport, the municipal ordinance supersedes county-level exemptions.

Specifically, Gulfport municipal code stipulates clearly that any property owner or representative undertaking the installation, erection, or replacement of a fence or gate on residential premises must first apply for and obtain a valid building permit from the city's Community Development Department. This process requires submission of a detailed site plan, clearly illustrating the precise location, dimensions, and placement of the fence or gate on the property. The required site plan must adhere strictly to the city's specifications, including the submission on standardized paper dimensions, typically 11 inches by 17 inches, accurately depicting property lines, fence location, setbacks, easements, and any other relevant site features. If deemed necessary by the city during the permitting review, submission of an official property survey completed by a licensed professional surveyor may also be mandated.

Under Gulfport's specific zoning regulations and building code provisions, residential fences erected or modified without the explicit authorization granted by the required city-issued permit are considered to be in violation of municipal law. Such installations can be subject to enforcement actions, including but not limited to, issuance of stop-work orders, monetary fines, mandatory removal or alteration directives, and additional administrative penalties.

While Pinellas County ordinances do offer broader leniency allowing the installation of residential fences six feet or shorter without permits in unincorporated regions, these county rules explicitly do not extend to properties within the incorporated municipal boundaries of the City of Gulfport. As such, the more stringent municipal ordinance requiring explicit permitting applies exclusively and fully to the property located at 2649 Tifton Street S, Gulfport, FL 33711.

Consequently, the fence shown in the referenced image, regardless of its actual measured height being under six feet, must be considered subject to Gulfport’s municipal permitting ordinance. Compliance with this law demands that any such fence must be properly permitted before installation, in strict accordance with the aforementioned regulatory guidelines provided under the City of Gulfport’s local building code and zoning regulations. Failure to adhere to these legal provisions will subject the property owner or responsible party to possible enforcement and penalty as described within Gulfport’s established municipal legal framework.


If your property is located in Gulfport, Florida, you cannot rely on Pinellas County's exemption for fences under six feet tall.

Even small or shorter fences in Gulfport require a city-issued permit because Gulfport is an incorporated city with its own specific rules separate from county-level exemptions.

Pinellas County's rule—that fences under six feet don't need a permit—applies only to properties outside Gulfport’s city limits (unincorporated areas).

In other words, because you're in Gulfport specifically, you must follow Gulfport’s city permitting rules, not the more lenient county-level rules.
