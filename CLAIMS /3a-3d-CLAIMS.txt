## Claim Title: Failure to Address Maintenance Issues

	•	Parties Involved:
	•	Primary Responsible Party: Luther Rollins.
	•	Statute Violated:
	•	§83.51(1)(a): “Landlord’s Obligation to Maintain Premises.”
	•	Summary: Requires landlords to maintain structural components and comply with health, building, and safety codes.

Claim Summary:

The landlord neglected significant maintenance issues, including a severely clogged kitchen sink, which rendered part of the property unusable. The tenant was forced to resolve the issue independently after 15 days of inaction. This constitutes a breach of habitability and statutory obligations.
	•	Evidence:
	•	Tenant’s emails and texts reporting maintenance issues.
	•	Photos of clogged sink and repair receipts showing tenant-paid resolution.
	•	Case Law Support:
	•	Durene v. Alcime, 448 So.2d 1208 (Fla. App. 1984): Habitability breaches expose landlords to liability for costs incurred by tenants.
	•	Claim Amount: Contributes to emotional distress damages of $5,000.
	
	
	
	
	
Claim Title: Failure to Address Security Concerns Following Break-In

	•	Parties Involved:

	•	Statute Violated:
	•	§83.51(1)(a): “Landlord’s Obligation to Maintain Premises.”
	•	Summary: Requires landlords to ensure structural safety, including functional gates, locks, and security features.

Claim Summary:
Following a March 26, 2024 break-in, the landlord failed to address critical security issues, including repairing broken gates, installing lockable mechanisms, and ensuring working motion-detecting lights. This neglect directly exacerbated the tenant’s PTSD and left the property vulnerable to future security breaches.

Evidence:
	•	Tenant’s emails requesting security repairs.
	•	Photos and police report documenting the break-in.
