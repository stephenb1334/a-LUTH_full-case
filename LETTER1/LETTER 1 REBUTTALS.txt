LETTER 1 REBUTTALS
COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL ANALYSIS: SECURITY DEPOSIT CLAIM DEFICIENCIES
STECE
I. IMPROPER USE OF FUTURE TENSE AND SPECULATIVE DAMAGES
The October 1, 2024 claim letter fundamentally violates Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a) through
pervasive use of future tense language and speculative damages, rendering the entire claim legally
insufficient. Florida law explicitly requires documentation of actual, incurred costs—not anticipated
expenses.
A. Systematic Pattern of Future Tense Violations
The letter demonstrates a consistent pattern of improper future tense usage that invalidates the
claim:
1. Cleaning Allegations
"Extensive cleaning will be required"
Legal Impact: Confirms no actual cleaning costs incurred
Violation: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) requirement for actual expenses
No documentation of completed work or paid invoices
Speculative nature invalidates claim element
2. Structural Repairs
"Repairs to the walls and surfaces will be necessary"
No current damage assessment provided
Absence of contractor estimates
No photographic evidence
Future repairs cannot justify present withholding
3. Waste Management
"Garbage and trash removal will be required"
No documentation of existing conditions
No waste removal quotes obtained
No municipal citations or notices
Speculative future service cannot support current deduction
4. Cost Calculations
"Replacement costs will be calculated"
Admits absence of current cost assessment
No itemized inventory of damages
No professional valuations
Direct violation of immediate accounting requirement
5. Landscape Restoration
"Yard and landscaping will need restoration"
No baseline condition documentation
No professional assessment completed
No actual restoration costs incurred
Pure speculation about future needs
B. Legal Implications of Future Tense Usage
The systematic use of future tense language creates multiple legal vulnerabilities:
1. Statutory Non-Compliance
Violates explicit requirement for actual costs
Undermines notice validity
Creates exposure to statutory penalties
Shifts burden of proof advantage to tenant
2. Evidentiary Deficiencies
No documentation of completed work
Absence of paid invoices
Lack of professional assessments
No proof of actual damages
II. SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT
A. Unlawful Deduction Framework
The landlord's approach to security deposit management demonstrates systematic violations of
Florida law:
1. Improper Cost Basis
Reliance on future expenses
Speculative damage assessments
Unverified replacement costs
No actual repair documentation
2. Documentation Failures
No itemized cost breakdown
Absence of supporting invoices
Lack of professional estimates
No photographic evidence
B. Reasonableness Assessment Impossibility
The claim's structure prevents any meaningful evaluation of cost reasonableness:
1. Cost Verification Issues
No individual item costs
No market comparisons
No depreciation consideration
No competitive estimates
2. Temporal Problems
Future costs cannot be evaluated
No current market benchmarks
Impossible to assess reasonableness
No actual expense documentation
III. CONTRADICTORY PROPERTY STATUS
A. Current Property Marketing
The property's current status directly contradicts damage claims:
1. Active Marketing Evidence
Property listed for rent as of October 4, 2024
Available for immediate showings
No visible damage in listings
Ready for occupancy status
2. Logical Inconsistencies
Claims of extensive damage vs. ready to show
Future repairs vs. current availability
Required restoration vs. immediate occupancy
Cleaning needs vs. showing condition
B. Legal Implications of Property Status
The property's marketing creates significant legal vulnerabilities:
1. Claim Credibility
Undermines damage assertions
Questions severity claims
Suggests minimal actual damage
Indicates possible bad faith
2. Documentation Issues
No evidence of completed repairs
No proof of necessary cleaning
No documentation of restoration
No support for claimed damages
IV. BURDEN OF PROOF ANALYSIS
A. Legal Standards
The landlord bears the burden of proving:
1. Actual Damages
Current condition documentation
Specific damage evidence
Causation proof
Cost verification
2. Reasonable Costs
Market-based pricing
Competitive estimates
Actual invoices
Professional assessments
B. Burden Shifting
The claim's deficiencies shift advantage to tenant:
1. Documentation Gaps
No baseline condition evidence
No damage documentation
No cost verification
No professional assessments
2. Legal Presumptions
Favors tenant in absence of proof
Creates statutory violation presumption
Supports bad faith retention claim
Justifies penalty considerations
DETAILED ANALYSIS OF ZACH STEINBERGER'S COMPROMISED POSITION
I. FINANCIAL MOTIVES AND CONFLICTS
1. Commission Structure Influence:
Initial Sale Commission: Earned approximately 2.5-3% ( 1M+ property
value)
Rental Commission: Typically one month's rent ($4,500 in this case)
Property Management Fees: Ongoing monthly percentage (usually 8-10% of 450/month)
Future Re-listing Potential: Additional commission opportunity on future sale
Impact: These financial stakes created strong incentive to favor landlord's positions
360-
2. Business Relationship Preservation:
Existing Portfolio Connection: Managed multiple properties for Luther Rollins
Referral Network: Luther's attorney status provided valuable professional connections
Future Listings: Potential access to high-value legal community properties
Professional Reputation: Relationship with prominent attorney enhanced market standing
Outcome: Led to biased decision-making favoring landlord's interests
II. UNAUTHORIZED LEGAL ACTIVITIES
1. Security Deposit Opinion (September 5, 2024 Email):
Direct Quote: "It is my professional opinion to not refund the security deposit"
Speculative Language: Used "will need" regarding future repair costs
Amount Specified: Recommended withholding entire $4,500 deposit
Lack of Expertise: No contractor quotes or professional assessments provided
Legal Overreach: Attempted to make binding determination without authority
2. Property Condition Assessment:
Move-out Inspection: Conducted without professional certifications
Damage Claims: Listed alleged issues without qualified verification
Cost Estimates: Provided repair figures without contractor input
Documentation: Failed to provide photographic evidence
Process: Bypassed proper inspection protocols

1. Your Statement
“I disagree with and deny all your allegations, accusations, and insinuations that I am a bad and/or
unlawful landlord. I rented you my personal vacation home for a term of months and I always
treated you with kindness, empathy, professionalism, and regard for the law.”
Response:
While I appreciate your perspective, the facts documented throughout our tenancy and during this
dispute contradict your characterization. The issues I raised—specifically regarding unresolved
maintenance requests, failure to secure the property following the break-in, withholding of my
security deposit without proper itemization, and your disregard for my personal property—
demonstrate non-compliance with Florida landlord-tenant statutes. These are legal matters, not
personal accusations.
2. Your Statement
“I have a copy of the written lease signed by you.”
Response:
I acknowledge the signed lease agreement, which is attached to this correspondence for reference.
However, the lease does not absolve you of your obligations under Florida law, including your duties
to maintain the property, return the security deposit with proper itemization, and handle personal
property appropriately.
3. Your Statement
“I have a copy of the inventory signed by Melissa when you moved in.”
Response:
I formally request that you provide a copy of this inventory. Neither I nor Melissa retained any
record of this document. Additionally, without photographic evidence or detailed descriptions, any
claims of damage or missing items lack a verifiable basis.
4. Your Statement
“I have photos of the premises both before and after your tenancy.”
Response:
I request copies of these photos for review. This evidence should substantiate your claims of
damage, including the specific walls, furnishings, and other items mentioned in your original claim
on the security deposit.
5. Your Statement
“I have receipts for removal of excessively damaged items, garbage & trash from the premises.”
Response:
If you have receipts for these claims, they should have been included in your original security
deposit claim letter as required by Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a). Failure to provide these within the
specified timeframe voids your ability to withhold the deposit for these reasons.
6. Your Statement
“I have texts from you that contradict your Response claims.”
Response:
I request copies of these texts for review. To my knowledge, all communication aligns with my
claims and is supported by evidence. For example, I have documented text messages and emails
where I explicitly requested the retrieval of my personal property and where I informed you of the
security concerns following the break-in on March 26, 2024.
7. Your Statement
“I cannot confirm or deny the presence of any specific alleged item of tenant personal property on
your Addendum B list.”
Response:
Your inability to confirm or deny the presence of my personal property further supports my claim
of unlawful conversion. Your current rental listing advertises “barbequing” as an amenity, which
suggests the continued presence of my Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill. I have attached
screenshots of this listing as evidence.
8. Your Statement
“I propose as full settlement and compromise of all matters between us the following: Refund you
500 for the rights, title, and ownership to all personal
property you claim to have left on the premises.”
Response:
I respectfully reject this settlement offer as it does not adequately address the legal violations or
financial losses I have incurred. My total claim of $8,710.62 represents:
• Full return of my $4,500 security deposit;
• Compensation for my $4,210.62 in personal property (value minus depreciation).
Additionally, I reserve the right to pursue statutory, punitive, and emotional distress damages
should this matter proceed to litigation.
9. Your Statement
“We need to talk and reach an agreement and put this matter behind us.”
Response:
While I appreciate your willingness to resolve this matter, I reiterate that all communications must
remain in writing. This is not only for clarity but also to ensure a documented record of all
interactions
1. General Principles Governing Legal Practice and Misrepresentation
In the state of Florida, the unauthorized practice of law (UPL) and the misrepresentation of one’s
status as a lawyer are serious offenses that can carry significant legal and ethical consequences.
• Florida Bar Rule 4-7.13: Misrepresentation is explicitly prohibited in any professional or personal
capacity. This rule applies not only to licensed attorneys but also to individuals who are not licensed
but represent themselves as legal professionals.
• Florida Statute §454.23: It is unlawful for anyone not licensed as an attorney in Florida to
practice law or hold themselves out as qualified to do so. Violating this statute can lead to criminal
penalties, including misdemeanor or felony charges depending on the context.
• Rule 4-8.4(c) of the Florida Rules of Professional Conduct: Lawyers are prohibited from engaging
in dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. While this rule applies directly to licensed
attorneys, a non-attorney who falsely claims to be a lawyer may still be subject to UPL sanctions.
1. Florida Bar’s Oversight of the Unauthorized Practice of Law
The Florida Supreme Court regulates the practice of law in the state, delegating UPL investigations
to the Florida Bar. Common forms of UPL include:
• Representing others in legal matters without being licensed to do so.
• Drafting legal documents or giving legal advice without proper authorization.
• Misleading others into believing one is an attorney, including using misleading email addresses,
titles, or verbal claims.
The Florida Bar has a well-established process for investigating and prosecuting UPL claims.
Individuals harmed by misrepresentation can file complaints with the Florida Bar.
1. Ethical and Legal Considerations for Misrepresentation
Misrepresentation of legal status has several implications:
• Unethical Conduct: If Luther J. Rollins, Jr. verbally claimed to be an attorney and used email
addresses like “luther2law@gmail.com” to reinforce this impression, it could be deemed misleading.
Even if he holds a law degree but is not actively licensed, representing himself as an attorney in
Florida without proper licensure is unlawful.
• Deceptive Conduct: Representing oneself as an attorney to tenants during a landlord-tenant
relationship could constitute fraudulent or deceptive practices. This may also breach Florida’s
Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA) if the misrepresentation influenced any
financial or contractual decision.
• Professional Implications: If Rollins is licensed in another state (e.g., North Carolina) but not
Florida, and he acted in a legal capacity in Florida, this could result in disciplinary action from the
bar association in his home jurisdiction. Cross-state misrepresentation may have professional
consequences in multiple states.
1. Use of a Non-Lawyer Disclosure Form
The “Nonlawyer Disclosure” form signed by Zach Steinberger and referenced in your lease
agreement provides an additional layer of complexity. This document appears to serve two
purposes:
• To clarify that Mr. Steinberger, as a real estate professional, is not acting as a legal representative.
• To ensure compliance with Rule 10-2.1(b) of the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar, which governs
the permissible scope of nonlawyer activity (e.g., document preparation, real estate forms).
If Luther presented himself as an attorney but had you sign a nonlawyer disclosure form under
Steinberger’s name, this could suggest an attempt to shield himself from scrutiny while retaining
the benefits of appearing to be a lawyer. This inconsistency warrants closer examination.
1. Specific Implications in Your Case
• Verbal Representations: If Luther verbally claimed to be a lawyer during your tenancy, this could
constitute misrepresentation under Florida law, especially if this claim influenced any decisions
regarding your lease or dispute.
• Use of “luther2law@gmail.com”: This email address reinforces the impression of being a licensed
attorney. Courts may consider such representations as attempts to deceive or gain undue influence,
particularly if no disclaimer was made clarifying his non-lawyer status.
• Impact on the Tenant-Landlord Relationship: Misrepresenting legal status could be used to
intimidate tenants, discourage disputes, or manipulate negotiations. If Luther invoked his
purported legal expertise during your interactions, this could constitute bad faith.
• Professional Consequences: If Luther is not a member of the Florida Bar, any legal advice or
representation he provided in Florida may constitute UPL. This could subject him to investigation
by the Florida Bar and potential criminal penalties under §454.23.
1. Reporting and Legal Remedies
If you believe Luther misrepresented his legal status:
1. File a Complaint with the Florida Bar: You can report potential UPL by submitting evidence
(e.g., emails, verbal claims) to the Florida Bar’s UPL department for investigation.
2. FDUTPA Claim: Misrepresentation of legal status may qualify as an unfair or deceptive practice
under FDUTPA, which could entitle you to damages if it caused harm.
3. Negotiate with Documentation: His alleged misrepresentation undermines his credibility. If this
issue goes to court, you can highlight this conduct as evidence of bad faith or fraud.
Conclusion
Based on the evidence and Florida law, Luther’s misrepresentation—if proven—could have
significant consequences. At minimum, it undermines his credibility in the tenant-landlord dispute.
If he provided legal advice or used his alleged status as a lawyer to influence your decisions, you
have grounds to pursue complaints with regulatory authorities and include this as part of your
overall case.

Factor in the below and into the revised response letter
From the provided documents and details, here are the key points and suggestions to refine your
approach to this dispute. I will structure this response in alignment with Florida statutes and legal
precedent to ensure it addresses your concerns about your dispute letter and the landlord’s
response.
Key Issues Identified in the Lease Agreement and Landlord Response
1. Inventory List and Personal Property Dispute:
• Your Argument: The landlord failed to provide an itemized inventory list as part of the lease, as
required to substantiate claims of damaged or missing property. Your dispute letter appropriately
references legal precedent, such as Johnson v. Baker and Durene v. Alcime, which support your
position.
• Suggested Strengthening: Emphasize that without an inventory list, the landlord lacks the
foundational evidence necessary to justify claims for “missing or damaged” items.
1. Security Deposit Handling:
• Your Argument: The landlord’s notice of claim on the security deposit does not comply with
Florida Statute §83.49(3). Specific failures include:
• Lack of itemization for claimed damages.
• No disclosure about how the deposit was stored (interest-bearing account, etc.).
• Suggested Strengthening: Add a direct reference to Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a) and §83.49(2),
reiterating the landlord’s obligation to maintain transparency about the security deposit’s location
and handling.
1. Failure to Maintain Premises:
• Your Argument: You documented maintenance issues early in the lease, including a clogged
kitchen sink, a broken fence gate, and general neglect. These failures forced you to undertake
reasonable maintenance actions, including tree pruning, which the landlord now disputes.
• Suggested Strengthening: Highlight the landlord’s obligation under Florida Statute §83.51 to
maintain the premises in a habitable condition. Include additional details of unfulfilled promises,
such as the fence repair, which directly impacted your safety.
1. Unauthorized Handling of Personal Property:
• Your Argument: The landlord mishandled your personal property after the lease ended and
included items (e.g., the grill) in rental listings without your consent. Florida law defines such
actions as conversion.
• Suggested Strengthening: Reference Florida legal definitions of conversion to underline the
seriousness of the landlord’s actions. Attach any available evidence (e.g., rental listings, photos of
the grill).
1. Legal Precedent and Burden of Proof:
• Your Argument: The landlord’s claims are speculative, lack evidence, and rely on unsupported
accusations. Florida law requires landlords to provide clear evidence of tenant-caused damage
beyond normal wear and tear.
• Suggested Strengthening: Expand your references to case law and include the principle that
landlords bear the burden of proving damage with documented evidence.
Steps to Improve Your Tenant Dispute Letter
1. Address Specific Legal Requirements:
• Add a section explicitly outlining the landlord’s failures to meet legal requirements under Florida
law (e.g., §83.49, §83.51).
• Specify deadlines the landlord missed, such as providing proper notice of the security deposit
claim or addressing maintenance requests.
1. Attach Supporting Evidence:
• Include all relevant evidence:
• Lease agreement pages showing the absence of an inventory list.
• Screenshots of the landlord’s rental listings referencing your personal property.
• Photos, receipts, or witness statements related to maintenance issues or personal property left
behind.
1. Include Your Proposed Resolution:
• Clarify your demands, such as a full refund of the security deposit and compensation for the
mishandling of personal property. Ensure these demands are consistent with Florida statutes on
damages.
1. Reiterate the Landlord’s Pattern of Neglect:
• Strengthen the timeline of events to highlight a clear pattern of landlord negligence. Mention
every documented communication about maintenance issues or property retrieval.
1. Request Mediation or Legal Action:
• If the landlord rejects your dispute, propose mediation or indicate your willingness to escalate the
matter to small claims court. Florida statutes favor mediation in such disputes.
Treble Damages and Next Steps
• Treble Damages: Florida law may allow treble damages (triple the amount of financial harm) in
cases involving willful and unlawful acts, such as the conversion of personal property. To pursue
treble damages:
• Establish that the landlord knowingly used your personal pr

This detailed breakdown demonstrates the systematic nature of Steinberger's compromised
position and the extensive documentation supporting claims of misconduct. Each point is supported
by specific incidents, communications, or actions that create a clear pattern of ethical and
professional violations.
V. CONCLUSION AND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS
The landlord's security deposit claim fails on multiple legal grounds:
1. Systematic Legal Violations
Pervasive future tense usage
Speculative damage claims
Improper cost documentation
Statutory non-compliance
2. Remedial Requirements
Return of full security deposit
Potential statutory penalties
Attorney fee exposure
Administrative consequences
3. Strategic Implications
Strong tenant position
Multiple challenge grounds
Significant landlord exposure
Clear statutory violations
The combination of future tense language, speculative damages, inadequate documentation, and
property marketing contradictions creates an legally untenable position for the landlord under
Florida law. The claim's fundamental deficiencies provide multiple grounds for challenge and
suggest bad faith retention of the security deposit, exposing the landlord to statutory penalties,
attorney fees, and potential punitive damages.
