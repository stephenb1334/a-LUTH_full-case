# Conversion in Florida Landlord-Tenant Disputes: Legal Analysis and Case Review

## Definition of Conversion in Florida Law

Under Florida law, conversion is clearly defined as "the exercise of wrongful dominion and control over property to the detriment of the rights of its actual owner."[3] More specifically, Florida courts have consistently described conversion as "an act of dominion wrongfully asserted over, and inconsistent with, another's possessory rights in personal property."[5][8] This definition originates from the frequently cited case *Goodwin v. Alexatos*, 584 So.2d 1007 (Fla. 5th DCA 1991).[4][8]

For a successful conversion claim in Florida, a plaintiff must establish three key elements:

1. The plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of the property
2. The defendant's conversion by a wrongful act or in a manner inconsistent with the plaintiff's property rights
3. Resulting damages[6]

Importantly, Florida law does not require the property to have a specific monetary value to establish conversion.[6]

## Application to Landlord-Tenant Disputes

In the landlord-tenant context, conversion typically occurs when a landlord wrongfully retains, uses, or disposes of a tenant's personal property after the tenancy ends. Florida has established specific statutory procedures that landlords must follow regarding abandoned property:

- Florida Statute §715.104(1) requires landlords to provide written notice to former tenants regarding personal property left on premises
- Florida Statute §715.109 establishes liability for landlords who convert tenant property without complying with notice and retrieval procedures
- Florida Statute §83.67(5) prohibits bad-faith conversion of tenant property for personal gain[1]

## Analysis of Your Case

Your case presents a strong conversion claim under Florida law:

### Strengths of Your Case

1. **Clear Evidence of Wrongful Dominion**: The Zillow marketing photos showing the Weber grill being used to advertise the property provide compelling evidence of wrongful control over your property.[1]

2. **Statutory Violations**: The landlord's alleged failure to provide written notice required by §715.104(1) strengthens your conversion claim, as it shows failure to follow mandatory procedures.[1]

3. **Documented Retrieval Attempts**: Your text messages attempting to coordinate property retrieval help establish that you did not intend to abandon the property. The specific text message stating: "I'm leaving town tonight indefinitely. It's the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property" clearly demonstrates your intent to retrieve your items.[2]

4. **Third-Party Confirmation**: The unsolicited witness observation from John Roman, who saw your grill at the property, provides independent verification that your property remained there and was being used by the landlord.[1]

5. **Multiple Claim Angles**: Your case appropriately addresses both the statutory violations (§715.104, §715.109) and the common law conversion claim, which maximizes potential recovery options.[1][2]

### Recommendations for Strengthening Your Case

1. **Document a Formal Demand**: One element of conversion is "a demand for the return of the property" and "a refusal to return the property."[4] Ensure you have clearly documented when you formally requested the return of your items and how the landlord refused.

2. **Valuation Evidence**: Provide specific values for each converted item. Include original purchase receipts, current retail prices for replacement, or expert appraisals for unique items like commissioned artwork.

3. **Timeline Clarity**: Create a precise chronology of events from lease end to discovery of property use in marketing materials. This will strengthen the narrative of ongoing conversion.

4. **Lease Agreement Analysis**: While you argue that provisions attempting to waive liability for abandoned property are void under §83.47, provide more specific details about what your lease actually states regarding abandoned property and whether you initialed specific clauses.[2]

5. **Conversion vs. Civil Theft**: Consider whether the landlord's actions meet the higher standard of civil theft, which adds "felonious intent" to the conversion elements. Civil theft allows for treble damages under Florida Statute §772.11, though it requires "clear and convincing" evidence rather than just a "preponderance of evidence."[4]

## Legal Precedent Application

*Goodwin v. Alexatos* is correctly cited in your claims. This case established that conversion consists of the wrongful exercise of dominion over property to the detriment of the rights of the actual owner. Florida courts have consistently applied this definition in subsequent cases, making it strong authority for your position.[4][5][8]

Your statutory claims under §715.104 and §715.109 are also well-founded, as these specifically address landlord requirements for handling abandoned property and establish penalties for non-compliance.

## Conclusion

Your case presents a valid conversion claim under Florida law. The core elements are present: your ownership of the property, the landlord's wrongful exercise of dominion (using your grill in marketing), and resulting damages. By implementing the suggested improvements, particularly documenting a formal demand for return and strengthening your valuation evidence, you can enhance your position for either settlement negotiations or court proceedings.
