FORGERY AND COUNTERFEITING


----

**Chapter 831, Florida Statutes: Forgery and Counterfeiting**: Might be referenced if there are disputes over the authenticity of lease agreements or other documents. It is suspected the lease was tampered with when the tenant requested an executed copy after the leaese had expired having not been provided one with all signatures before, or during, the lease agreement. When it was received by Zach Steinberger of Compass realty, the signature transction ID's were overlapping. The software used was Transaction Desk the the authentic IDs (a string of characters created that is encoded information of signing, ip address, date of signing, etc.) should not overlap. This technology is called "Authentisign" ID by Transaction Desk. 

Secondly, the landlord, Luther Rollins, used the tenants rental address, the house being leased at 2649 Tifton St. S. Gulfport, FL 33711 as his own, applied identically as "Landlord Address" on five instances on the same lease agreement. The landlord used: 2649 Tifton St. S. Gulfport, FL 33711 as the Landlord Address.
