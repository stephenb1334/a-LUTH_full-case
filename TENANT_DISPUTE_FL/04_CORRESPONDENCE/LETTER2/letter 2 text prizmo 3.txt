Short Answer to Your Preliminary Question
Yes, I can read every word of the OCR’d PDF you supplied. I’ve reviewed all the relevant lease text, including the clause about the landlord’s purported non-liability for personal property upon “surrender, abandonment, or the tenant’s death.” Below is a detailed analysis of how that clause applies (or doesn’t) in your scenario—especially given that (1) the designated box was not initialed, and (2) no “death of the last remaining tenant” occurred.

1. Context and Text of the Clause

From your screenshot and lease excerpt, Section 29 says:

	“TENANT’S PERSONAL PROPERTY. TENANT MUST INITIAL IN THIS BOX [ empty box ] FOR THE FOLLOWING PROVISION TO APPLY:
BY SIGNING THIS RENTAL AGREEMENT, THE TENANT AGREES THAT UPON SURRENDER, ABANDONMENT, OR RECOVERY OF POSSESSION OF THE DWELLING UNIT DUE TO THE DEATH OF THE LAST REMAINING TENANT, AS PROVIDED BY CHAPTER 83, FLORIDA STATUTES, THE LANDLORD SHALL NOT BE LIABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR STORAGE OR DISPOSITION OF THE TENANT’S PERSONAL PROPERTY.”

Key observations:
	1.	There is a box for the tenant to initial if they agree to that provision.
	2.	You said no initials appear in the box, nor is there any separate rider or note that your signature stands in place of those initials.
	3.	The language references “surrender, abandonment,” or “the death of the last remaining tenant.”

2. Relevance of “Death” vs. Your Actual Scenario
	•	You have not died, so the “due to the death of the last remaining tenant” part is plainly inapplicable.
	•	You also have not abandoned your property in the sense of refusing to retrieve it; you explicitly requested retrieval.
	•	The lease ended normally (end of term), you promptly told the landlord/agent about leftover items, and you made multiple attempts to get them.

Because there was no “death scenario,” the portion of the text referencing “recovery of possession of the dwelling unit due to the death of the last remaining tenant” is wholly irrelevant to your actual situation.

3. Effect of the Empty “Initial” Box

The lease states:

	“TENANT MUST INITIAL IN THIS BOX [  ] FOR THE FOLLOWING PROVISION TO APPLY.”

Since the box is not initialed:
	1.	Contractual Non-Applicability: Under basic contract principles, if the landlord specifically writes, “Tenant must initial to make the clause effective,” but you did not initial, that clause is presumably not in effect.
	2.	No Waiver of Rights: Without your initials, you have not agreed to waive the landlord’s liability or disclaim the landlord’s duty to handle your personal property.
	3.	Even If It Were Initialed: Florida Statutes (e.g., § 83.67(5) and Ch. 715) have strict rules about how personal property is handled post-tenancy. A clause that attempts to disclaim that liability entirely can still be void under Fla. Stat. § 83.47, if it conflicts with mandatory notice requirements. But that question is moot here because you never gave effect to the clause by initialing.

4. Florida Statute § 83.67(5) & Ch. 715 (Abandoned Property)
	•	§ 83.67(5): “A landlord…shall not remove the tenant’s personal property from the dwelling unit unless…surrender, abandonment, or a lawful eviction. If provided in the rental agreement…landlord is not required to comply with s. 715.104, etc.” But that “if provided in the rental agreement” only applies if the tenant actually consents via a properly executed clause (often including the “legend in substantially the following form…”).
	•	Ch. 715.104: Typically requires a landlord to give written notice to the former tenant about the property’s location and how long they will store it. They can only disclaim these responsibilities if the lease meets the statutory conditions—and if you actually agreed to it (e.g., by initialing).

Here, the relevant “BY SIGNING THIS RENTAL AGREEMENT…” language is present, but the key is that the lease itself says it only “applies” if you initial that box. Since you did not, the landlord cannot rely on that disclaimer to avoid storing or safely disposing of your items.

5. Landlord’s Obligations in Your Scenario

Because the box is not initialed:
	1.	Landlord Retains Liability: The landlord must follow the standard statutory process for leftover property—i.e. “Do I consider it abandoned? Did the tenant request retrieval? Must I store it? Provide notice under § 715.104?”
	2.	Tenant’s Attempt to Retrieve: You texted promptly, showing a clear intention to pick up the leftover items. You cannot be deemed to have “abandoned” them. Under Florida law, the landlord cannot unilaterally treat them as abandoned or disclaim responsibility.

If the landlord disregarded your attempts, cut off communication, and then used or disposed of the items, that is potentially a violation of Florida law—e.g. conversion or wrongdoing under §§ 715.04–715.109. The disclaimers about “no liability upon death or abandonment” do not apply because:
	•	No valid initial to enact that clause,
	•	No death scenario,
	•	No actual abandonment from you, as you explicitly tried to retrieve your property.

6. Landlord’s Possible Defenses

Even though the “death” clause is irrelevant to your living scenario, the landlord might argue:
	1.	General Clause about Abandonment: They might say you “abandoned” the property if you physically left the premises. But your texts prove you intended retrieval. Florida courts generally require the landlord to show the tenant’s clear relinquishment. Because you have evidence of wanting to pick up the items, it defeats an “abandonment” argument.
	2.	“By signing the entire lease, you accepted the clause.” They might try to say your overall signature is enough. However, the lease specifically says that you must initial the box for the clause to apply, so your general signature on the final page does not override the lease’s own instruction that a separate box must be initialed.
	3.	No response: The landlord may claim “we never got the text,” or “the items were worthless,” or “the property was already surrendered.” But the documented requests from you, plus the listing agent’s text telling you to contact Luther directly, show they had notice you wanted to retrieve. This undercuts a defense of ignorance or valid disposal.

7. Practical Outcome

Given that:
	•	You did not initial the box,
	•	You actively sought retrieval of your property,
	•	The “no liability after tenant’s death” portion is inapplicable because you are alive,

the landlord likely cannot rely on Section 29’s “no liability for personal property” disclaimers to absolve themselves of wrongdoing if they withheld your belongings, refused to coordinate retrieval, or disposed of them improperly.

8. Conclusion and Summary
	1.	The Clause Doesn’t Apply: Because the personal-property disclaimer (Section 29) explicitly requires tenant initials to activate, and you did not initial that box, that disclaimer is void for your situation.
	2.	No Death Scenario: Even if you had initialed it, the clause specifically references the “death of the last remaining tenant.” You are alive, so it still wouldn’t apply.
	3.	Landlord Still Owes Duties: Under Florida law, the landlord must follow statutory procedures for leftover property, especially since you immediately sought to retrieve it. You can also argue it was never abandoned. The disclaimers about “abandonment or death” do not shield the landlord if they are ignoring your retrieval efforts.
	4.	Potential Claims: If the landlord obstructed retrieval or used your property (like the Weber grill) without your permission, that may give you a strong basis for conversion, statutory violations under Chapter 715 or § 83.67, or a direct claim for damages.

Hence, the “Tenant Must Initial” clause is effectively null in your case. The landlord must handle your property in compliance with Florida law, and if they did not, you retain your rights and remedies under § 715.104, § 83.67, or any other applicable sections.

RE: SECURITY DEPOSIT CLAIM &
2023-2024 LEASE OF 2649 TIFTON ST.S., GULEPORT, FD

TENANT PERSONAL PROPERTY DISPUTE

Dear Stephen and Melissa,

I hope you are doing well. We were hit by the recent hurricanes both in North Carlina and Florida, so we are in the process of repairs and recovery. Thankfully, no severe damages. We are much luckier than so many others.

This letter is in response to your «Formal Tenant Response & Dispute" documents (the "Response") which I recently received from you.

I disagree with and deny all your allegations, accusations, and insinuations that I am a bad and/or unlawful landlord. I rented you my personal vacation home for a term of months and I always treated you with kindness, empathy, professionalism, and regard for the law.

I have no desire to engage in a time-consuming, costly, emotional, and uncertain legal dispute with you. Be assured, however, that I will vigorously defend my position and my rights as a homeowner and landlord. I never imagined that our relationship would end in any sort of dispute, and I am surprised, disappointed, and somewhat disheartened as I write you this letter.

Much of what you say in your Response is not accurate and/or is exaggerated at best. In your response you admit that you would take responsibility provided evidence was provided. Please be aware that: I have a copy of the written lease signed by you
I have a copy of the inventory signed by Melissa when you moved in I have photos of the premises both before and after your tenancy I have photos of each area outlined in my claim for security deposit I have photos of the damages outlined in my security deposit claim I have witnesses to the condition of the premises after your tenancy.
I have witnesses to your negligent treatment of the premises I have receipts for removal of excessively damaged items, garbage & trash from the premises
I have texts from you that contradict your Response claims I have your Sept. 4th pm text message where you clearly state you are "leaving town [and Florida?] tonight indefinitely"
I have phone records that show you never called me to retrieve your personal property.

I cannot confirm or deny the presence of any specific alleged item of tenant personal property on your Addendum B list. Do you have proof that all the alleged items were left at the premises when you vacated? Did you and/or other parties leave personal property without my permission in, on and around the premises? I have not converted or sold any personal property that I reasonably believed was left behind/abandoned by you. Furthermore, I am not responsible for storing personal property items that you knowingly had delivered to and/or left behind at the premises after the lease expired.

Despite all the above, I believe we should be able to resolve this matter amicably and informally without legal action. We need to talk and reach an agreement and put this matter behind us. I have not engaged a lawyer, but I am sure they would advise that we talk and try to work this out (included below is my phone number).

Accordingly, here is my written suggestion and counteroffer to your previous options.
I propose as full settlement and compromise of all matters between us the following
1.) Refund you $1,500 of the security deposit; and
2.) Pay you $500 for the rights, title, and ownership to all personal property you claim to have left on the premises; and 3.) All parties mutually waive and relinquish their rights to any further litigation regarding these matters as allowed by law.

I am available to discuss the above settlement offer, details, or any changes to resolve. If we reach agreement, I would be able to transfer the funds to you electronically or by cashier's check. Finally, if we cannot negotiate a settlement of all matters, I would be willing to attend a mediation or other form of alternative/expedited dispute resolution to resolve our dispute.

Thank you for your attention and consideration and I anticipate that we will be able to reach a mutually acceptable settlement.

sincerely,
And, 

Rollite.

[Landlord’s Address]

Dear Mr. Rollins,

Thank you for your recent letter, in which you addressed my “Formal Tenant Response & Dispute” documents. I appreciate your willingness to reach an amicable resolution, but several points in your letter require immediate clarification—particularly your citation of my September 4th text message, your disclaimers about storing personal property, and the lease provision referencing “the death of the last remaining tenant.” I also note your references to Florida Statute § 83.67(5) and your belief that you “reasonably believed” I abandoned my possessions.

Below is a point-by-point analysis of why these arguments are inapplicable under Florida law, why the “no liability” clause in Section 29 of the lease does not apply, and how your conduct likely exposes you to statutory damages of up to 3 months’ rent ($13,500), given the approximate $4,210.65 value of my personal items.

1. Clause in Section 29 – “No Liability for Tenant’s Property”

1(a). Empty Initial Box

Section 29 of the lease states:

	“TENANT MUST INITIAL IN THIS BOX [ ] FOR THE FOLLOWING PROVISION TO APPLY… [Landlord not liable for property…].”

I never initialed that box. Consequently, under the lease’s own language, the “no liability” provision does not apply. Where a contract specifically calls for initials to activate a clause, but the tenant does not initial, the clause is not in effect. My general signature at the end does not override Section 29’s explicit requirement of an initial in that box.

1(b). “Death of the Last Remaining Tenant”

Even if I had initialed, the text specifically references “recovery of possession… due to the death of the last remaining tenant.” I am very much alive, and I clearly never abandoned my property; I explicitly requested retrieval. Therefore, the “no liability” language about “death” is irrelevant to our actual scenario— no occupant died, and you effectively blocked me from retrieving my property.

2. Florida Statutes vs. Your Disclaimers

2(a). Statutory Obligations for Personal Property

You wrote: “I am not responsible for storing personal property items that you knowingly had delivered to and/or left behind…”
However:
	•	Fla. Stat. §§ 83.67(5) & 715.104 typically require landlords to store or properly handle leftover possessions, especially when the tenant immediately seeks to retrieve them.
	•	The disclaimers in your lease (Section 29) are void (under § 83.47) if they conflict with mandatory statutory protections—especially when I never initialed the “no liability” clause.
	•	Since you actively prevented me from entering or retrieving my items by ordering your agent, Mr. Steinberger, to cease communication, you cannot claim that these items were abandoned.

2(b). Abandonment vs. My Retrieval Efforts

You claim you “reasonably believed” I abandoned property, citing my text message stating I was “leaving town indefinitely.” But you omit the crucial context:
	1.	I had a truck in front of the property on September 4th, fully intending to pick up my belongings.
	2.	Mr. Steinberger had just told me he was instructed by you to “cease communication.”
	3.	I then texted you:
	“Hi Luther, I’m leaving town tonight indefinitely. It’s the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands… I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank you.”
That text clearly shows I wanted to retrieve my items and was seeking your instructions. You never responded.
	4.	Under Florida law, “abandonment” typically requires a clear relinquishment. My repeated pleas to retrieve items prove otherwise.

3. Your September 4th Text Reference & Phone Records

You mention:

	“I have your Sept. 4th pm text message… I have phone records that show you never called me…”

Respectfully, a phone call was unnecessary; I texted you directly to coordinate pickup. You simply did not answer. Florida law does not require me to place a phone call if you refuse to answer or your agent “ceases communication.” So you effectively blocked retrieval by ignoring my text while physically present at 2649 Tifton St.

4. Landlord’s Potential Liability (3 Months’ Rent)

4(a). Statutory Damages

Under Fla. Stat. § 83.67 and related provisions:

	“A landlord who violates any provision of this section shall be liable to the tenant for actual and consequential damages or 3 months’ rent, whichever is greater, and costs, including attorney’s fees.”

My leftover property—valued at approximately $4,210.65 (based on fair depreciation and used-market comparables)—is less than three months’ rent (3 × $4,500 = $13,500). Because the statute says “whichever is greater,” I may be entitled to $13,500 plus costs and attorney’s fees if a court finds you violated § 83.67 by refusing retrieval and potentially converting or disposing of my belongings.

4(b). Conversion Allegations

You acknowledged or implied you might be using or re-marketing my Weber grill. That can constitute conversion under Florida common law. If proven, I could pursue civil theft claims under Fla. Stat. § 772.11, possibly allowing treble damages. This risk further underscores the seriousness of blocking my retrieval efforts.

5. Response to Other Claims in Your Letter
	1.	Inventory or Photos: You say you have “photos” or “receipts,” but you never shared them. The law requires proper itemization and notice for any security-deposit deductions or property you retained.
	2.	Witnesses: If your witnesses claim I “neglected” the premises or left “excessive trash,” that does not justify withholding my personal property or ignoring my retrieval attempts.
	3.	Settlement Offer: You propose $1,500 deposit refund plus $500 for “ownership” of my property. This is an arbitrary amount, ignoring my documented item valuations. It also overlooks your potential liability for obstructing retrieval.

6. Conclusion & Path Forward
	•	Section 29 is inapplicable—I never initialed it, and there was no death scenario.
	•	Florida law requires you to honor my explicit requests for retrieval and not treat the items as abandoned.
	•	Your refusal to respond or facilitate pick-up—while physically present at the property—could be seen as a willful violation of §§ 83.67 & 715.104.
	•	Potential Damages easily exceed the $2,000 total you offered, given Florida law’s “3 months’ rent” penalty for violations.
	•	I remain open to a fair resolution, but the core facts show you bear responsibility. Should you wish to avoid further escalation, I urge you to discuss a more realistic settlement, or promptly return my property if it still exists in your possession.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to reaching a reasonable resolution that respects the facts and applicable Florida statutes.

Sincerely,

TENANT’S REBUTTAL AND EXTENDED LEGAL ANALYSIS

Below is an organized, topic-by-topic response to the points raised in the landlord’s letter, as well as an expanded discussion of Florida Statute compliance, burden of proof, and potential damages. The structure employs bold headings, legal tonality, and bullet points for clarity. The purpose is to demonstrate why the landlord’s positions are inaccurate, unsubstantiated, and legally vulnerable under Florida’s landlord-tenant statutes.

I. OVERVIEW OF THE PERSONAL PROPERTY DISPUTE
	•	Landlord’s Assertion: “I have no responsibility to store property left after the lease expired… I believed you abandoned it.”
	•	Tenant’s Reality: The tenant (me) explicitly requested retrieval, did not abandon property, and never agreed to a “no liability” clause.
	•	Florida Statutes: Under Fla. Stat. §§ 83.67 & 715.104, a landlord must follow set procedures to store or properly dispose of leftover items, especially when the tenant promptly seeks retrieval.

Bottom Line: The landlord’s refusal to coordinate pickup, ordering an agent to “cease communication,” and ignoring my presence with a rented truck contravene Florida’s notice and disposal requirements.

II. THE “NO LIABILITY UPON DEATH OR ABANDONMENT” CLAUSE IS INAPPLICABLE

A. Clause Language & Un-initialed Box
	•	Section 29 states:
	“TENANT MUST INITIAL IN THIS BOX [ ] FOR THE FOLLOWING PROVISION TO APPLY…The Landlord shall not be liable…(etc.)”
	•	Key Points:
	1.	The box is not initialed, so the clause is void.
	2.	Even if initialed, it references the “death of the last remaining tenant,” a scenario that never occurred.

Therefore, the landlord’s attempt to disclaim liability under that text is legally ineffective.

B. Death Scenario Irrelevant
	•	Landlord’s Clause: Purports to disclaim liability for property if the tenant died or abandoned items.
	•	Facts:
	•	I am alive.
	•	I made clear attempts to retrieve belongings.
	•	Legal Conclusion: Any mention of “death of the last tenant” does not apply. A living tenant cannot trigger that portion of the lease.

C. Statutory Override
	•	Fla. Stat. § 83.47: Voids any lease provision purporting to waive or preclude landlord responsibilities mandated by law.
	•	Ch. 715: Mandates notice and holding periods for leftover items.
	•	Implication: Even if the box had been initialed, disclaiming all landlord liability for personal property is likely unenforceable under these statutes.

III. EVIDENCE OF RETRIEVAL EFFORTS & WASTED TRUCK RENTAL

A. The September 4th Text: Context vs. Landlord’s Quote
	•	Landlord’s Claim: “You said you’re ‘leaving town tonight indefinitely,’ so I believed it was abandoned.”
	•	Full Context:
	•	I had a large rented pickup truck outside the premises on September 4th, specifically to haul away items (the Weber grill, hammock, TV, etc.).
	•	I texted: “It’s the only opportunity to get the other belongings… I understand however you want to handle this.”
	•	This clearly indicates intent to remove property, not abandonment.

Conclusion:
Taking the snippet “leaving town indefinitely” in isolation is a strategic mischaracterization. I was actively on-site with a truck, hoping for your cooperation that never came. This forced me to:
	1.	Extend the truck rental unnecessarily, incurring more costs.
	2.	Create backup plans (local moving company, friends to help load items, local storage facility) in anticipation of your responding within a few days, per standard Florida practice.
	3.	End up with a wasted truck rental window because your communication ceased.

B. No Abandonment Where Tenant Seeks Retrieval
	•	Florida courts generally hold that “abandonment” requires a tenant’s clear relinquishment of possessions. I repeatedly sought retrieval, so any “abandonment” claim fails.
	•	Your Silence effectively blocked me from picking up my property—not the behavior of a landlord acting in good faith.

IV. BURDEN OF PROOF: SHIFTING TACTICS & QUESTIONS

Your letter states:

	“I cannot confirm or deny any item on your list… Do you have proof the items were left behind? Did you or others leave property without my permission…?”

A. Misplaced “Burden of Proof” Attempt
	•	Observations:
	•	You vaguely question whether I “really left these items” or whether they existed.
	•	Under Florida law, if you claim damage or disposal rights, you typically bear the burden of proof for claims against the tenant or for proving “abandonment.”
	•	This line of questioning is not a good-faith resolution attempt; it’s a legal tactic to shift the burden to me.

B. Vague Security Deposit Claim & Missing Evidence
	•	Original security deposit notice: Provided broadbrush claims, lacking itemized costs or actual evidence.
	•	Professional Opinion from Realtor: You used a short statement from your agent, Mr. Steinberger, claiming the deposit should be kept. That is neither a formal contractor’s estimate nor an arborist’s statement about alleged tree damage. It fails statutory requirements for specificity.

Conclusion:
Your queries—“Did you have proof?”—are rhetorical attempts to invert burden of proof. In Florida’s landlord-tenant framework, a landlord must produce clear evidence if they keep the deposit or claim property was abandoned. Merely posing open-ended questions is not compliance with statutory deposit or property-handling rules.

V. POTENTIAL DAMAGES & 3× RENT PENALTY

Under Fla. Stat. § 83.67(5), a landlord who violates the provisions relating to personal property disposal, denial of access, or forced abandonment may be liable for:
	•	“Actual and consequential damages or 3 months’ rent, whichever is greater.”
	•	My rent was $4,500/month, so three months equals $13,500.
	•	My leftover items are valued at about $4,210.65 based on fair depreciation and real market comparables. Because $13,500 is greater, the statute entitles me to that higher figure plus costs and attorney’s fees if your violation is established.

A. Potential for Treble Damages (Civil Theft or Conversion)
	•	If your actions are deemed a conversion or a violation under Fla. Stat. § 772.11 (civil theft), the court could impose treble (triple) damages.
	•	That scenario could push an award from $13,500 (the statutory floor in landlord-tenant provisions) to as high as $40,500 if proven to be willful conversion or theft.
	•	These are not empty threats; case law supports awarding significantly higher amounts when landlords act in blatant disregard of the tenant’s property rights.

VI. CONTRADICTING YOUR OWN ASSERTIONS
	1.	“I have not sold or converted your property.”
	•	Contradiction: You have re-advertised the backyard with “barbecuing” as an amenity, though that was not an amenity in the prior year’s listing. Also, textual evidence from a neighbor referencing the grill in December 2024 strongly suggests you still have it. That’s effectively using or converting my personal property.
	2.	“I can’t confirm or deny items on your list.”
	•	Contradiction: Meanwhile, you claim you have pictures, inventory, and a witness. If so, you must produce that evidence, not deflect by asking me to prove what was left behind.
	3.	“Witnesses to your negligent treatment.”
	•	Contradiction: A realtor’s “professional opinion” is not an arborist’s or licensed contractor’s opinion. Also, no matter the property condition, it doesn’t allow you to obstruct retrieval of personal belongings.

VII. MR. STEINBERGER’S RELIABILITY & POTENTIAL ETHICAL BREACH
	•	Nonlawyer Disclosure: The lease’s front page states he is “not a lawyer or paralegal,” so he cannot legally counsel you or me about “keeping a deposit.”
	•	National Association of Realtors (NAR) Code of Ethics: Providing “professional opinions” about property damage or assessing alleged tree harm without qualification can breach NAR’s standards. If he is the “witness” you reference, I will contest his reliability on multiple grounds.

VIII. FINAL POINTS & CONCLUSION
	1.	Clause on “Death of Last Tenant” is moot: I am alive; you cannot disclaim liability.
	2.	No Abandonment: My text explicitly requests a method to pick up items. No good-faith reading concludes “abandonment.”
	3.	Statutory Damages: By refusing retrieval or converting my property, you risk liability of up to 3 months’ rent ($13,500) and possibly treble that amount for civil theft if proven.
	4.	Burden of Proof: If you claim I damaged the premises or didn’t leave certain items, you must produce itemized, substantiated evidence under Florida law—not rhetorical questions.
	5.	Next Steps:
	•	Comply with my retrieval demands or return the property if still in your possession.
	•	If you disposed of it, the statutory penalties potentially apply.
	•	Your $2,000 settlement offer is unworkable, given the statutory guidelines and the property’s real value.

I remain open to a good-faith resolution but will pursue all remedies under Fla. Stat. §§ 83.67, 715.104, and 772.11 if you do not comply or fairly compensate me for the withheld items and the costs I’ve incurred (e.g., wasted truck rental time, mental anguish, and any professional moving quotes I had to secure while waiting for your response).

End of Analysis.
