# CLAIM: INVALIDITY OF LEASE PROVISIONS ATTEMPTING TO WAIVE OR CIRCUMVENT STATUTORY TENANT RIGHTS, UNLAWFUL OBSTRUCTION OF ACCESS TO PERSONAL PROPERTY, AND CONVERSION


### I. Introduction

This claim asserts that the landlord, **Luther J. Rollins, Jr.** (hereinafter “Landlord”), has engaged in multiple violations of Florida statutues, and thus, multiple Florida statutes while violating fundamental tenant rights through:

1.  **Unlawful obstruction** of the tenant’s efforts to retrieve personal property left on the premises.
2.  **Conversion** of such property for the landlord’s own use or benefit.
3.  **Reliance on void or unenforceable lease clauses** purporting to waive or limit statutory tenant protections in contravention of **Florida Statute § 83.47**.
4.  **Attempt to circumvent statutory tenant rights** through invalid or unenforceable lease provisions. 

Florida Statute § 83.47 **explicitly voids and renders unenforceable any clause in a rental agreement** that purports to waive or limit any of the tenant’s rights, remedies, or statutory protections under the Florida Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (Part II of Chapter 83). This statutory safeguard ensures that tenants cannot be coerced or tricked into relinquishing fundamental consumer protections that Florida law deems non-negotiable.

Despite these clear legal standards, the Landlord has systematically failed to adhere to the state’s mandated procedures for handling personal property left behind by a former tenant, has refused to grant the tenant a reasonable opportunity to retrieve their belongings, and has inserted (or relied on) lease provisions that contravene the tenant’s statutorily guaranteed rights. Consequently, all such invalid lease provisions—particularly those purporting to waive liability for the Landlord’s unlawful conduct—are void.  

Below is a rewritten, integrated version that incorporates the strengths of both drafts while preserving clarity, thoroughness, and legal rigor. It uses headings to organize the factual background, legal basis, harm to the tenant, and requested remedies.

II. Parties
-----------

1.  **Claimant (Tenant):**  
    _YourNameYour NameYourName_, a former tenant at the property located at _PropertyAddressProperty AddressPropertyAddress_ in Florida.
    
2.  **Respondent (Landlord):**  
    **Luther J. Rollins, Jr.**, acting individually and/or through any unregistered entity, including but not limited to “Amarlu Enterprises.”
    
3.  **Agent (Realtor):**  
    **Zach Steinberger**, who, at the Landlord’s direction, allegedly ceased communication with the Claimant, obstructing the retrieval of personal property and potentially facilitating conversion of tenant belongings.
    

* * *

III. Factual Background
-----------------------

1.  **Lease Termination & Personal Property Left Behind**
    
    *   The Claimant’s lease for the residence ended on or about _LeaseEndDateLease End DateLeaseEndDate_.
    *   Due to storm delays and logistical hurdles (e.g., cancellation of movers, PTSD-driven panic attacks on move-out day), some personal property remained at the premises. Among these items:
        *   **Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill**
        *   Various household tools, furniture, and miscellaneous possessions
    *   The Claimant promptly informed the Landlord of these leftover items and requested time to retrieve them.
2.  **Tenant’s Explicit Retrieval Attempts**
    
    *   On or around _September 4, 2024_, the Tenant rented a truck and texted the Landlord:
        
        > _“I’m leaving town tonight indefinitely. It’s the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property. I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank you.”_
        
    *   Despite this clear expression of **intent to retrieve** the property, the Landlord instructed his agent, **Zach Steinberger**, to “cease communication.”
    *   This directive cut off the only viable channel for scheduling pick-up, resulting in **wasted costs** for the Tenant (e.g., truck rental fees, potential moving-company charges, and storage deposits).
3.  **No Statutory Notice or Coordination**
    
    *   **Fla. Stat. § 715.104** requires a landlord to send written notice describing any personal property left behind, providing the tenant an opportunity to reclaim items before disposition or sale.
    *   Here, the Landlord never served the statutory notice nor provided a reasonable window for reclamation. Instead, he ignored repeated requests and **used** or **advertised** the Weber Grill as a backyard amenity in re-listing the property.
4.  **Lease Provision Purporting to Disclaim Liability**
    
    *   A lease clause stated that upon “surrender, abandonment, or the tenant’s death,” the Landlord “shall not be liable or responsible for storage or disposition” of the Tenant’s property.
    *   Critically, **the Tenant did not initial** the separate box required for this disclaimer to apply, and, even if it had been initialed, **any attempt to waive the Landlord’s statutory duties under §§ 83.47 and 715.104 is void** as a matter of Florida law.
5.  **Landlord’s Conversion of Property**
    
    *   By refusing to permit retrieval and actively retaining/using the Tenant’s property (including the Weber Grill to market the home), the Landlord exercised wrongful dominion over items still lawfully belonging to the Tenant.
    *   Under Florida law, such acts constitute **conversion** when the rightful owner (Tenant) is deprived of possession or use.

* * *

IV. Legal Basis
---------------

1.  **Invalid Lease Clauses Under Fla. Stat. § 83.47**
    
    *   Florida law holds any lease provision void if it purports to waive or preclude the statutory rights or remedies set forth in Part II of Chapter 83.
    *   The Landlord’s reliance on a “no liability” clause—particularly one not initialed by the Tenant—cannot override the Landlord’s mandatory obligations to follow **§ 715.104** (notice requirements for abandoned property).
    *   Any attempt to disclaim liability for property post-tenancy is unenforceable if it conflicts with statutory duties.
2.  **Fla. Stat. § 715.104**: **Notification of Former Tenant of Personal Property**
    
    *   The Landlord must provide written notice specifying what was left behind and a date by which it must be claimed.
    *   The Landlord never furnished such notice, thus denying the Tenant the chance to reclaim items lawfully.
3.  **Fla. Stat. § 715.109**: **Liability for Noncompliance**
    
    *   A landlord in violation of §§ 715.10–715.111 is liable for actual damages or three months’ rent (whichever is greater), plus costs.
    *   Because the Landlord’s behavior plainly ignored these mandates—no notice, no retrieval coordination—the Tenant is entitled to damages under this section.
4.  **Conversion Under Florida Common Law**
    
    *   Conversion arises where one wrongfully exerts dominion over another’s property, depriving the owner of possession or use.
    *   By advertising, retaining, or otherwise using the Tenant’s items and preventing retrieval, the Landlord committed **conversion**.
5.  **Cutoff of Communication as Unlawful Obstruction**
    
    *   The Landlord’s direction to the agent (“cease communication”) obstructed the Tenant’s timely retrieval.
    *   This malicious act in bad faith caused additional financial harm (truck fees, etc.) and heightened emotional distress.

* * *

V. Harm to the Tenant
---------------------

1.  **Financial Losses**
    
    *   **Value of Personal Property**: The Tenant lost possession of items worth $X, including a Weber Spirit E-310 Grill ($\_\_\_), plus other furniture or tools.
    *   **Wasted Expenses**: Truck rental fees, time off work, friend or professional mover scheduling, local storage unit deposits—all wasted due to the Landlord’s communication cutoff.
    *   **Potential “Three Months’ Rent” Statutory Damages**: Under **§ 715.109**, the Tenant could claim the higher of actual losses or three months’ rent if the Landlord is found in willful violation.
2.  **Emotional & Psychological Distress**
    
    *   The Tenant experienced severe anxiety and exacerbated PTSD symptoms from both the earlier home-invasion trauma and the Landlord’s refusal to cooperate, leaving property retrieval in limbo.
    *   The sense of betrayal and helplessness when the Landlord severed communication further heightened emotional harm.
3.  **Violation of Statutory Rights**
    
    *   The Landlord robbed the Tenant of the statutory right to be **notified** and granted a reasonable opportunity to recover belongings.
    *   The immediate communication cutoff underscores the Landlord’s bad faith.

* * *

VI. Remedies Sought
-------------------

1.  **Declaratory Judgment**
    
    *   An order declaring **void** any lease provision purporting to waive or limit liability for property left behind, in contradiction of **Fla. Stat. § 83.47**.
2.  **Immediate Return or Compensation for Personal Property**
    
    *   If still in the Landlord’s possession, the personal property (including the Weber Grill) must be returned forthwith.
    *   If disposed of, used, or sold, the Tenant seeks the **full value** or replacement cost of each item wrongfully withheld or converted.
3.  **Statutory Damages Under Fla. Stat. §§ 715.104 and 715.109**
    
    *   Actual damages or **three months’ rent**, whichever is greater, plus costs and attorney’s fees, for willful noncompliance with abandoned property notice laws.
4.  **Conversion Damages**
    
    *   Compensatory damages for wrongful dominion over the Tenant’s belongings.
    *   Potential **punitive damages** if the Landlord’s actions are deemed malicious, oppressive, or in reckless disregard of the Tenant’s rights.
5.  **Attorney’s Fees & Costs**
    
    *   Recovery of legal fees incurred, as permitted under any applicable lease clause or statutory provision allowing fees to the prevailing party in landlord-tenant disputes.
6.  **Injunctive Relief**
    
    *   Prohibiting the Landlord from disposing of or further using the Tenant’s remaining property.
    *   Requiring the Landlord to cooperate and allow the Tenant a final opportunity to retrieve items, with notice and a fixed deadline.

* * *

VII. Conclusion
---------------

By refusing to coordinate retrieval, withholding or using the Tenant’s personal property, and **unlawfully relying** on a lease clause that attempts to waive the Landlord’s statutory obligations, the Landlord has violated **Fla. Stat. §§ 83.47, 715.104, and 715.109**, as well as Florida common law doctrines of conversion. These actions caused the Tenant specific financial losses, severe emotional distress, and constituted a willful disregard for the tenant’s rights under Florida law.

The Tenant respectfully requests that this Court:

1.  **Void any lease clause** purporting to waive or limit the Landlord’s liability for unclaimed property.
2.  **Order the immediate return** of or fair compensation for the Tenant’s personal items, including the Weber Grill.
3.  **Award statutory damages** (actual or three months’ rent) under **Fla. Stat. § 715.109**, plus any additional remedies deemed just and proper—such as **conversion damages, punitive damages,** and **attorney’s fees**—to fully address the harm and dissuade future unlawful conduct.

Respectfully submitted,
