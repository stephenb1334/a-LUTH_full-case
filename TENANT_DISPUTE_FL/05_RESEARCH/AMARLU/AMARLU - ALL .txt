## BUSINESS ADDRESS MISREPRESENTATION AND EVOLUTION

RE: Documentation of Address Irregularities Date: [Current Date]

**I. CHRONOLOGICAL ADDRESS DOCUMENTATION**

        A. Initial Business Filing (July 7, 2023) 231 Government Ave. SW #3097 Hickory, North Carolina 28603-3097
        
        B. First Certified Letter Return Address 231 Government Ave. SW #3097 Hickory, NC 28603 Documentation Date: [Specific Date]
        
        C. Subsequent Correspondence Address 231 Government Ave. SW PO Box #3097 Hickory, NC 28603
        
        D. Final Known Address PO Box #3097 Hickory, NC 28603



**II. MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATION ANALYSIS**

1.  Address Evolution Pattern
    
    -   Progressive removal of street address elements
    -   Transition from physical address to P.O. Box only
    -   Consistent use of incorrect ZIP code
    -   Omission of required business address components
2.  Legal Implications
    
    -   Violation of federal business address requirements
    -   Non-compliance with business registration standards
    -   Pattern of deliberate address misrepresentation
    -   Evasion of proper business identification requirements

3.  Documentation Purpose This record establishes a pattern of progressive address misrepresentation, demonstrating systematic attempts to obscure legitimate business location and contact information in violation of applicable federal regulations.
B. Physical Location Verification: The P.O. Box Deception Unveiled

Subject: Address Verification and Compliance Analysis

This report delves into significant findings regarding the address listed as 231 Government Ave. SW #3097 in Hickory, NC. Contrary to the implications made by the landlords, this address is categorically NOT a commercial office space. 

**Address Investigation Findings:**
1. **Location Confirmation:** The report accurately identifies the site as a USPS facility, not a commercial establishment.
2. **Zip Code Verification:** The report recognizes the correct zip code as 28602, yet the previously used incorrect zip code remains in circulation.
3. **Commercial Office Availability:** There is no commercial office space available at this location.
4. **Suite Verification:** The address claims a suite #3097, which does not exist within the facility, indicating fabrication.

**USPS Facility Analysis:**
- **Building Type:** Federal Postal Facility 
- **Commercial Space Availability:** Few - No business suite or office accommodations in this building offers a space for rent with #3097, per Realtors as of mid-November 2024, who are currently marketing a small office location in the same building.  
- **Public Access:** Limited to postal services only 
- **Private Box Services:** Standard USPS offerings 

This verification uncovers several critical compliance violations:
1. **Violation of "No P.O. Box" Mandate:** Federal regulations prohibit the use of P.O. Boxes as business addresses in most cases.
2. **Misrepresentation of Physical Location:** The landlords are misrepresenting their business location.
3. **Improper Business Address Registration:** The listed address is unsuitable for business registration purposes, but was used for company filinig for Assumed Name form submission in the State of North Carolina despite the form stating "NO PO BOX" for applying entities. 
4. **Non-compliance with State Statutes:** The use of a P.O. Box and the subsequent misrepresentation of physical location contravene North Carolina state regulations.
5. **Misuse of Federal Facility Address:** Employing a federal postal facility address in this context represents a direct misuse of federal resources.
6. **Inadequate Commercial Address Representation:** The provided address misleads potential tenants, suggesting the existence of a legitimate commercial address where none exists.
7. **Potential Mail Fraud Implications:** This manipulation raises possible concerns under mail fraud laws.
8. **USPS Policy Violations:** Utilization of a P.O. Box address in this manner violates various USPS policies.


### IV. FLORIDA PROPERTY OPERATIONS AND COMPLIANCE: A SECOND ARENA OF ABUSE

  

Issues related to property ownership and leasing practices in Florida expose an additional layer of noncompliance and exploitative conduct.

  

**A. PROPERTY OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE: THE “INDIVIDUAL” SHELL GAME**

Public records indicate a deliberate effort to obfuscate ownership and evade regulatory oversight:

• **Property Type:** Residential property, situated in Florida.

• **Legal Owner:** Titled to “Luther J. Rollins, Jr.” as an individual rather than in any corporate capacity.

• **Ownership Documentation:** The property is personally owned in the landlord’s name, yet day-to-day operations suggest a separate business identity, “Amarlu Enterprises.”

• **Absence of Formal Management Company:** No official entity is in place to manage or maintain the property, indicating a lack of registered property management.

• **No Registered Business Entity:** By avoiding standard corporate structures (e.g., LLCs or corporations), the landlords conduct Florida rental operations without the typical safeguards or disclosures required by law.

• **Informal Payment Collection:** Tenants are instructed to mail rent to a North Carolina P.O. Box, circumventing recognized financial channels.

• **Unauthorized Business Operations:** Collecting rent in Florida without a duly registered foreign or domestic entity exemplifies the disregard for Florida’s statutory requirements.

  

**B. LEASE AGREEMENT ANALYSIS: A MASTERCLASS IN OMISSION**

The lease executed for the Florida property raises serious concerns about omissions and misleading provisions:

• **Document Structure:** While the landlord’s personal names appear, the business entity purportedly handling financial matters—Amarlu Enterprises—does not.

• **Parties to Agreement:** Nominally listed are “Luther J. Rollins, Jr.” and “Mary O. Polk” as landlords, alongside two tenant signatories.

• **Business Entity Identification:** Nowhere does the lease mention Amarlu Enterprises, the entity actually collecting the rent.

• **Management Company Information:** No property management firm is disclosed, leaving tenants with unclear recourse for maintenance requests or disputes.

• **Legal Operating Authority:** The lease offers no statement clarifying who holds valid operating authority in Florida or acknowledges any required state-level registration.

• **State-Required Disclosures:** Essential disclosures mandated by Florida law appear absent or incomplete.

• **Payment Instructions vs. Actual Practice:** Although any lease references are vague, tenants were verbally directed to mail checks to a P.O. Box in North Carolina, effectively funneling payments to an unregistered enterprise.

• **Unauthorized Entity Designation:** The mismatch between stated owners on the lease and the named entity receiving rent creates a significant legal anomaly.

• **Improper Payment Processing:** With no legitimate banking or escrow procedures, the lease arrangement fails to mirror lawful Florida practices.

  

These findings illustrate a concerted effort to obscure the nature of the landlords’ activities and to evade multiple layers of statutory obligations in both North Carolina and Florida. By operating under personal names for property titles while directing rent to an unregistered business, the landlords have established a risky, legally precarious arrangement for all parties involved.


## Legal Analysis: Florida Landlord-Tenant Violations

This section consolidates the analysis of Florida regulatory compliance issues, documented communication patterns, and legal violations, presenting a more streamlined and impactful argument.

**I. Florida Regulatory Non-Compliance: A Deliberate Pattern**

The landlords, Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk, have demonstrated a clear pattern of non-compliance with Florida's landlord-tenant laws and business regulations. This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate strategy to evade accountability and exploit tenants.

-   **Business Registration Violations:**
    -   **Unregistered Foreign Entity:** Amarlu Enterprises, the entity used to collect rent, is not registered as a foreign entity in Florida, a direct violation of **Florida Statutes § 605.0902**. This renders their business operations in Florida illegal and their lease agreements unenforceable.
    -   **Lack of State Authorization:** The landlords failed to obtain the necessary state licenses and authorizations to conduct property management and real estate operations in Florida.
    -   **Improper Documentation:** The landlords lack the proper documentation to conduct business legally in Florida, further undermining their legitimacy.
-   **Property Management Violations:**
    -   **Unauthorized Operations:** The landlords are conducting unauthorized business operations by collecting rent through an unregistered entity.
    -   **Improper Rent Collection:** The landlords are collecting rent in a manner that circumvents normal channels and using an illegitimate business name.
    -   **Missing Licenses:** The landlords lack the required property management licenses, if applicable, to operate legally in Florida.
    -   **Non-Compliant Documentation:** The lease agreement fails to meet the specific requirements of Florida statutes, rendering it legally deficient.

**II. Deceptive Communication and Address Manipulation: A Strategy of Obfuscation**

The landlords' communication patterns and address manipulations reveal a deliberate strategy to deceive and obstruct the tenant's ability to exercise their legal rights.

-   **Certified Mail Obstruction:**
    -   **Failed Delivery Attempts:** Multiple failed delivery attempts, USPS system rejections, and address verification failures indicate a deliberate attempt to use an invalid address.
    -   **Manual Intervention:** The need for personal retrieval and a USPS facility visit confirms the use of a P.O. Box, not a legitimate business address.
    -   **Identity Verification:** The requirement for identity verification further confirms the use of a P.O. Box, not a commercial business address.
-   **Address Manipulation:**
    -   **P.O. Box Transition:** The shift from a formal street address to a P.O. Box is a clear violation of the "No P.O. Box" mandate and a deliberate attempt to conceal their true location.
    -   **Increasing Informality:** The omission of the street address and the use of an incorrect zip code demonstrate a pattern of increasing informality and a disregard for proper business practices.
    -   **Pattern of Evasion:** The address manipulations are a calculated attempt to evade scrutiny and complicate their paper trail.
    -   **Documentation Inconsistencies:** Multiple format variations, inconsistent presentations, missing required elements, and non-standardized usage of the address further demonstrate a pattern of deception and non-compliance.



# Tenant’s Argument: Unenforceability of the Lease:

  

**The tenant claims that the lease is void or unenforceable due to the landlord's illegal conduct.**

  

Payments to an undisclosed and unregistered entity violate Florida law and demonstrate bad faith, overshadowing any claim for property damages.

  

**Good Faith Argument:**

  

The tenant asserts they acted in good faith by adhering to the lease terms as written, including fulfilling rent obligations. Any proven damages are minor and do not excuse the landlord’s broader statutory violations.

  

**Offset of Damages:**

  

Even if the court finds the tenant liable for damages, the tenant requests an offset against statutory damages, treble damages for deposit mishandling, and restitution of improperly collected rent.

  

Furthermore, as to the landlord’s recent written claim for the entire $4,500.00 security deposit, I must reiterate the dire legal implications arising from your unlawful conduct. While you have notified me, via certified mail within the statutory deadline, of your intent to impose a claim against the full security deposit, the alleged damages you describe—ranging from excessive trash and spoiled food to unauthorized alterations, missing items, and purported impact on a legacy jackfruit tree—must be evaluated against the backdrop of your underlying statutory violations and the enforceability of the lease itself.

  

Florida law (Fla. Stat. § 83.49) sets forth clear standards for security deposit claims, requiring landlords to provide concrete, itemized evidence of any damages beyond normal wear and tear. General assertions, unsupported by photographs, inventories, or receipts establishing pre- and post-tenancy conditions, typically fail to satisfy these standards. Without verifiable documentation—such as a signed move-in checklist, itemized valuations of each allegedly missing or damaged furnishing, and verifiable repair estimates—a court would be disinclined to uphold a claim for the full $4,500 deposit. Normal expectations of tenancy, including some level of cleaning upon move-out, do not justify the wholesale forfeiture of the deposit. Minor incidents, like temporarily spoiled food, are not substantial grounds for withholding the entire sum, and any claim of unauthorized alterations or missing items must be accompanied by explicit proof and pre-approved conditions stated in the lease.

  

More importantly, the entire contractual framework upon which your claim depends is compromised by your deliberate use of an undisclosed and unregistered foreign entity—Amarlu Enterprises—to receive all rental payments, including the security deposit. Under Fla. Stat. § 605.0902, any out-of-state entity conducting business in Florida must register as a foreign entity. Your conscious choice to funnel $45,000 in rent plus the $4,500 security deposit through an entity never disclosed in the lease and never registered in Florida renders the contract you seek to enforce legally questionable, if not outright void. As a result, a court would likely find that you lack standing to enforce provisions of a lease founded upon unlawful business operations. In other words, even if you could demonstrate legitimate damages (which you have not), the legal taint of your noncompliance with Florida’s foreign entity registration requirements would likely invalidate your claim on the security deposit.

  

This critical legal defect is compounded by the absence of transparent disclosure of Amarlu Enterprises in the lease, as well as your ongoing attempts to circumvent the statutory and good-faith obligations that Florida imposes on landlords. Given these facts, a Florida court, upon thorough examination, would almost certainly lean toward invalidating your entire claim and requiring the full return of the security deposit to me. The court may also, in light of such bad faith and statutory noncompliance, consider treble damages or other remedies designed to penalize landlords who fail to adhere to Florida’s clear statutory mandates.

  

In sum, while you have formally claimed $4,500 in supposed damages, the legal reality is that your own violations overshadow any unproven, undocumented assertions about cleaning or property damage. Without proper registration of your foreign entity, without clear, itemized evidence of actual damages, and without a lease free from deception and misrepresentation, you stand on legally indefensible ground. Under these circumstances, I have every reason to believe the court would not only reject your claim for the full $4,500 security deposit but would also potentially award me statutory damages for your bad-faith retention and serious legal violations.



**III. Legal and Regulatory Violations: A Comprehensive Breach**

The landlords' actions constitute a comprehensive breach of both North Carolina and Florida laws, as well as federal regulations, thus, to my concern only, it appears to violate every term that never existed legally within the lease in question.


___



# Summary of Facts: Amarlu Enterprises, Amarlu Company, & Amarlu Consultants


The dispute between me, whom represents the rights to two individual tenants on the lease in question, and the landlords, Luther J Rollings & Mary. O. Polk, highlights serious legal, ethical, and procedural violations related to the landlords' failure to comply with Florida statutes and established landlord-tenant obligations. The landlords, Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk, have knowingly orchestrated a rental arrangement that involves undisclosed entities, misrepresentation, and potential tax evasion, all of which jeopardize the enforceability of the lease agreement and undermine tenant protections under Florida law.

Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina entity, receives all rental payments despite being completely omitted from the lease. This concealment not only obscures the true contractual obligations but also violates statutory requirements for foreign entity registration and disclosure under Florida law. The landlords' actions have raised critical questions about transparency, compliance, and good faith in their dealings with tenants. 

The involvement of Mr. Zachary “Zach” Steinberger, acting in dual roles as a realtor with vested interests in future business dealings with the landlords, further complicates the matter, casting doubt on the impartiality and credibility of his evaluations.

This summary of facts underscores the legal implications of the landlords’ conduct, ranging from potential fraud and tax evasion to statutory violations. It establishes the foundation for the tenant's legal recourse and regulatory scrutiny to ensure accountability and adherence to Florida’s landlord-tenant laws.

**Landlord and Entity Identification:**

The lease agreement explicitly names only Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk as landlords, acting in their individual capacities. Despite this, rent payments were directed to Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina-registered entity jointly owned by Rollins and Polk. However, the signed lease entirely omits this entity, concealing its critical role in collecting rental income.

**Payment Instructions and Practice:**

-   Upon move-in, tenants received pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes instructing them to pay rent to Amarlu Enterprises at 231 Government Ave #3094, Hickory, NC 28602.
-   Over the 10-month lease term, the tenants paid a total of $45,000 in rent to Amarlu Enterprises—an entity never disclosed in the lease or mentioned as a legally recognized party in Florida.

**Corporate Registration and Legal Compliance in Florida:**

-   Amarlu Enterprises is registered in North Carolina but does not appear in the Florida Division of Corporations’ database.
-   Under Florida Statutes § 605.0902, any out-of-state business entity engaging in business activities, including collecting rental income from Florida property, must register as a foreign entity.
-   Amarlu Enterprises’ failure to register in Florida constitutes a direct violation of Florida’s foreign entity registration requirements, compromising its legal standing and the landlords’ compliance with state business laws.

**Misrepresentation, Lack of Disclosure, and Tax Concerns:**

-   Instructing tenants to pay a non-disclosed, unregistered entity (Amarlu Enterprises) undermines tenants’ understanding of their contractual obligations and potentially violates Florida’s landlord-tenant transparency laws.
Diverting rental income through an unregistered foreign entity raises concerns about possible tax avoidance or evasion. If landlords intend to obscure the flow of income to circumvent Florida tax obligations, they may face severe legal consequences, including penalties, fines, and potential criminal charges.

**Fraud and Deception:**

The deliberate omission of Amarlu Enterprises from the lease agreement and the subsequent instruction to pay that entity could be construed as fraudulent. This setup potentially deceives tenants about the true nature of their rental arrangement and circumvents their legal and tax obligations in Florida.

**Involvement of Mr. Steinberger (Realtor):**

-   Mr. Zachary “Zach” Steinberger of Compass Realty in St. Petersburg, Florida, has ties to these transactions, including discussions regarding future real estate dealings with Luther.
-   Due to his vested interest in securing listings and ongoing work with Luther, Mr. Steinberger’s involvement presents a clear conflict of interest.
-   As a realtor, Mr. Steinberger is not a legally recognized authority on evaluating damages or providing a professional legal opinion. His input on the matter of damages or legal compliance is therefore null and void, lacking the requisite impartiality and professional credentials to influence legal or financial assessments in this dispute.




***



## OBSERVED VIOLATIONS

1.  **Foreign Entity Registration Violation:**  
    Amarlu Enterprises, as an out-of-state business collecting rental income in Florida, failed to register as a foreign LLC, breaching Florida Statutes § 605.0902.
    
2.  **Transparency and Disclosure Failures:**  
    Directing rent to an undisclosed entity violates the fundamental principle of informed consent in landlord-tenant relationships. Tenants were never made aware that their payments would go to Amarlu Enterprises, undermining trust and legal clarity.
    
3.  **Tax and Regulatory Risks:**  
    Using an unregistered entity to collect rent in Florida raises questions about accurate tax reporting and compliance with Florida state tax obligations.
    
4.  **Potential Fraud:**  
    Concealing Amarlu Enterprises’ role suggests intentional deception. Such fraudulent conduct can lead to civil and potentially criminal liability, including claims for damages, restitution, and attorney’s fees.
    
5.  **Conflict of Interest and Expert Validity:**  
    Mr. Steinberger’s opinions regarding damages or legal compliance lack professional standing due to his role as a realtor seeking business with Luther. His involvement cannot serve as a credible neutral evaluation of damages or liabilities.
    

***

The landlords’ orchestrated arrangement—omitting Amarlu Enterprises from the lease, instructing tenants to pay the unregistered entity, and potentially manipulating tax responsibilities—indicates a willful departure from lawful and transparent business practices. Such conduct undercuts the integrity of the landlord-tenant relationship, potentially harms tenants financially, and places the landlords at risk of significant legal penalties.

While Luther’s status as a legitimate attorney may shield him from allegations of misrepresenting his professional credentials, it does not absolve the legal obligations of registering Amarlu Enterprises as a foreign entity in Florida or disclosing it in the lease. The conflict of interest arising from Mr. Steinberger’s involvement and his lack of professional standing to assess damages only further highlights the need for impartial legal scrutiny and regulatory intervention.

The actions of landlords, particularly in directing rent through an undisclosed and unregistered entity, violate Florida’s statutory requirements and raise serious concerns regarding fraud, tax evasion, and overall legal compliance. These matters merit thorough regulatory review and, if unresolved, potential civil litigation to ensure accountability, restitution, and adherence to Florida’s laws governing foreign entities and landlord-tenant relationships.


### **Landlord’s Legal Violations**

1.  **Failure to Register a Foreign Entity (Florida Statutes § 605.0902):**
    
    -   The landlord's use of **Amarlu Enterprises**, a North Carolina entity, without registering it as a foreign entity in Florida constitutes an illegal business practice.
    -   The lease agreement's enforceability is undermined because the landlord conducted business unlawfully. Courts often hold that parties conducting illegal business cannot enforce contractual agreements based on that activity.
2.  **Non-Disclosure of Amarlu Enterprises:**
    
    -   The lease agreement identifies the landlords as individuals (Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk) but does not disclose **Amarlu Enterprises** as a party involved in rent collection.
    -   Courts may interpret this omission as **fraudulent misrepresentation** or **bad faith**, rendering the lease terms invalid or unenforceable.
3.  **Consequences of Non-Compliance:**
    
    -   Florida law typically prevents unregistered entities from bringing claims in Florida courts until compliance is achieved. Thus, even if the landlord proves the tenant caused damages, the landlord may lack the legal standing to pursue those claims.

SUMMARY OF FACTS: AMARLU ENTERPRISES, AMARLE OMPANY, & AMARLU CONSULTANTS
A dispute involving these entities on one side, representing the interests of two individual tenants, and on the other, the landlords (Luther J. Rollins & Mary O Polk-reveals critical failures to honor Florida statutes and recognized landlord-tenant standards. The landlords' arrangement involves undisclosed foreign entities, potential misrepresentations, and possible tax infractions, all undermining the lease's enforceability under Florida law.
though the lease lists only Luther and Mary in their personal capacities, all rent
ultimates
North Carolina entity never disclosed in
the lease nor registered in Florida, contravemns..
.ablioations placed on
landlords. Such omissions violate foreign entity registration requirements, ammnishing legal clarity for tenants.
Landlord's Use of Mr. Zachary "Zach" Steinberger
The presence of Mr. Steinberger, a realtor potentially motivated by continued business dealings with Luther, complicates the situation. His input may be compromised by personal interests rather than an unbiased professional assessment, rendering it questionable in evaluating damages or compliance questions.

TENANT'S POSITION ON UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE LEASE
The tenant argues that the lease cannot be enforced because:
﻿﻿All rental payments were funneled through a non-disclosed and unregistered entity, violating Florida's rules for foreign entities.
﻿﻿Any claim for damages is overshadowed by these statutory breaches, likely nullifying the landlord's attempts to enforce provisions related to the security deposit or alleged damages.

Good Faith and Offset
6
The tenant fulfilled rental obligations in good faith. Should any property damages exist, they would be nominal and must be offset against any statutory violations, deposit withholdings, or other improper actions by the landlord.
LANDLORD'S CLAIM FOR ENTIRE $4,500 SECURITY DEPOSIT
Under Fla. Stat. § 83.49, landlords must give precise, itemized notices with verifiable documentation. General allegations excessi


ve trash, spoiled food, unauthorized alterations, or unverified claims about missing furnishings lack legal sufficiency if not supported by comprehensive before-and-after evidence.
Connection to Unregistered Entity
Because the landlord used a non-disclosed, unregistered foreign entity to handle a court may find the entire arrangement defective. There is limited or no stand-force the lease's clauses or to claim the security deposit in full, particularly compliant documentation.

This section consolidates the analysis of Florida regulatory compliance issues, documented communication patterns, and legal violations, presenting a more streamlined and impactful argument.
I. Florida Regulatory Non-Compliance: A Deliberate Pattern
The landlords, Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk, have demonstrated a clear pattern of non-compliance with Florida's landlord-tenant laws and business regulations.
This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate strategy to evade accountability and exploit tenants.

**COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL ANALYSIS: SECURITY DEPOSIT CLAIM
DEFICIENCIES**
**I. IMPROPER USE OF FUTURE TENSE AND SPECULATIVE DAM-AGES**
The October 1, 2024 claim letter fundamentally violates Florida Statute
§83.49(3)(a) through pervasive use of future tense language and speculative dam-ages, rendering the entire claim legally insufficient. Florida law explicitly requires documentation of actual, incurred costs-not anticipated expenses.
**A. Systematic Pattern of Future Tense Violations**
The letter demonstrates a consistent pattern of improper future tense usage that
invalidates the claim:
1. *Cleaning Allegations*
﻿﻿"Extensive cleaning will be required"
﻿﻿Legal Impact: Confirms no actual cleaning costs incurred
﻿﻿Violation: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) requirement for actual expenses
﻿﻿No documentation of completed work or paid invoices
﻿﻿Speculative nature invalidates claim element
2. *Structural Repairs*
﻿﻿"Repairs to the walls and surfaces will be necessary"
﻿﻿No current damage assessment provided
﻿﻿Absence of contractor estimates
﻿﻿No photographic evidence
﻿﻿Future repairs cannot justify present withholding
3. *Waste Management*
﻿﻿"Garbage and trash removal will be required"
﻿﻿No documentation of existing conditions
﻿﻿No waste removal quotes obtained
﻿﻿No municipal citations or notices
﻿﻿Speculative future service cannot support current deduction
4. *Cost Calculations*
﻿﻿"Replacement costs will be calculated"

This selective quotation and misrepresentation represent a clear attempt by the landlord to avoid his legal obligations under Florida Statute §715.104234. This statute outlines the procedures a landlord must follow when a tenant leaves personal property behind, requiring written notice to the former tenant that describes the property and allows a reasonable opportunity for retrieval before disposing of the items. By misrepresenting the tenant as having abandoned their property, the landlord attempted to circumvent these statutory requirements.
The full context of the tenant's message, which the landlord deliberately ignored. clearly shows the tenant's intent to retrieve their remaining possessions. The tenant's statement, "It's the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property," indicates that the tenant understood their belongings remained at the property and was seeking the chance to collect the "other belongings" from the landlord. This message communicates that the tenant did not intend to abandon the property but, rather, was expressing their intention to retrieve it. The tenant's message clearly ar

The lan
rd's mi representation of the tenant's text message is further exac-

oy their blatant failure to respond to the tenant's numerous requests for
retrieving their persoral property. On multiple occasions, specifically on September 25, 2024, and September 27, 2024, the tenant submitted written requests requesting ac ess to the property to collect their belongings. Unfortunately, these requests were ig nored by the landlord, who demonstrated a clear pattern of negligence and disregard or the tenant's rights. This behavior indicates a troubling intent on the part of the andlord to unlawfully withhold and convert the tenant's property for their own use.
The deliberate misrepresentation of the tenant's messages, coupled with the landlord's consistent neglect of their attempts to reclaim their belongings, illustrates a significant pattern of bad faith.

1.2 Failure to Maintain a Habitable Property
Under Fla. Stat. §83.51(1), landlords are required to ensure properties meet all building, housing, and health codes. Key incidents during my tenancy include:
﻿﻿January 2024: A severely clogged kitchen sink rendered the property unsanitary for 15 days. You failed to arrange repairs, forcing me to handle the issue independently.
﻿﻿March 2024: Faulty motion lights and deteriorated gates facilitated a violent home invasion. Despite acknowledging these safety concerns, you took no action to address them.
﻿﻿April 2024: Overhanging tree limbs above outdoor electrical cables created hazardous conditions. Neglected vegetation, including bamboo, an alleged jackfruit tree, and other trees, added to safety risks.
