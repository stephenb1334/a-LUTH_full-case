REVIEW the attached documents, including the comprehensive report on Mary O. Polk and Luther J. Rollins Jr., property records, business entity filings, court records, and the concerning details of the lease agreement and property listing discrepancies. My initial assessment reveals a complex web of potential legal violations and deceptive practices warranting a full-scale CIA-level investigation.

My preliminary findings indicate a deliberate pattern of financial fraud perpetrated by Luther J. Rollins Jr., potentially with the knowledge and complicity of Mary O. Polk. This pattern spans multiple states and involves:

Tax Evasion (Missouri and North Carolina): Consistent underreporting of property values on deeds to minimize transfer taxes suggests a long-running scheme to defraud state revenue agencies. The use of nominal consideration, discrepancies between sale prices and assessed values, and the complex LLC transfers raise significant red flags.

Fraudulent Conveyances (North Carolina and Florida): The rapid transfers of property between seemingly interconnected LLCs (DAB and JTB) followed by the sale to Rollins and Polk raise strong suspicions of fraudulent transfers designed to shield assets and obscure true ownership. The timing of these transfers, the use of nominal consideration, and the lack of clear business purpose for these LLCs warrant deep scrutiny.

Shell Company Abuse (Florida): AMARLU Enterprises' unregistered status in Florida, while actively collecting rent, suggests deliberate evasion of legal and regulatory requirements. This points to the potential for undisclosed income and tax liabilities.

Landlord-Tenant Violations (Florida): Mishandling of security deposits, failure to provide a legally required registered agent in Florida, and unlawful conversion of tenant property (the Weber grill) constitute clear breaches of Florida landlord-tenant law. Rollins’ legal background exacerbates these violations, indicating a conscious disregard for legal and ethical obligations.

Deceptive Business Practices (North Carolina and Florida): Misrepresentation of addresses on official documents, including the conflation of residential and business addresses and the mislabeling of mailboxes, appears designed to obfuscate legal communications and hinder proper service of process. This pattern of deception is evident in both property records and business filings.

Real Estate Listing Fraud (Florida): Manipulation of Zillow listings, including the suppression of prior rental history, resetting of "days on market," and the unauthorized use of tenant property in listings, indicates a deliberate attempt to mislead potential renters and buyers. The involvement of the real estate agent in these manipulations requires further investigation.

Strategic Investigative Plan:

Financial Audit: A comprehensive financial audit of Rollins, Polk, and all associated entities (AMARLU, DAB, JTB) is paramount. This should include bank records, tax filings, and any financial disclosures related to the properties in question. We will leverage FinCEN data and collaborate with the IRS to identify undisclosed income, offshore accounts, and any suspicious financial transactions.

LLC Unraveling: The relationships between DAB, JTB, AMARLU, and Rollins/Polk must be thoroughly investigated. We need to obtain the operating agreements for these LLCs, identify all members and managers, and analyze the financial flows between these entities. The common attorney involved in the North Carolina deeds may hold key information.

Address Verification and Geolocation Tracking: Cross-referencing all addresses used by Rollins and Polk across multiple databases (USPS, property records, business filings) is crucial to confirm their validity and expose any deceptive practices. We can use advanced geolocation and cell tower analysis to reconstruct their movements and corroborate timelines.

Digital Forensics and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT): We need to secure and analyze all available digital evidence, including social media activity, email communications, online reviews, and website data related to the properties and businesses in question. This OSINT analysis can reveal hidden connections, corroborate witness testimony, and expose inconsistencies in their narratives.

Witness Interviews: Conducting discreet interviews with neighbors, previous tenants, real estate agents, and other individuals connected to the properties will be essential to gather firsthand accounts, confirm patterns of behavior, and identify additional potential witnesses.

Undercover Operation: Placing an undercover agent posing as a potential renter or buyer for the Gulfport property could provide direct evidence of ongoing deceptive practices and potentially illicit activity related to AMARLU Enterprises.

Legal Collaboration: Coordinating with the relevant authorities—including state revenue agencies, attorneys general, real estate licensing boards, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service—will be crucial to initiate legal proceedings and ensure successful prosecution. Evidence of a pattern of misconduct across multiple jurisdictions strengthens the case for coordinated legal action.

I'm confident that a multi-pronged, intelligence-driven investigation will uncover the full extent of Rollins and Polk's deceptive practices, build an airtight case for prosecution, and send a clear message that financial fraud and abuse of tenant rights will not be tolerated. I’m prepared to brief the Director on these preliminary findings and request authorization for the next phase of this operation.

Comprehensive Report on Mary O. Polk & Luther J. Rollins Jr. – Missouri Records (1995–2025)

Background & Association

Mary Olivia Polk (M.D.) and Luther J. Rollins Jr. are a St. Louis-area couple known professionally as a physician and an attorney, respectively. They became engaged in 2015  and later married (Mary is identified in 2019 obituaries as Mary Olivia (Luther Rollins Jr.) Polk ). Their professional and personal dealings in Missouri span real estate, trust holdings, business entities, and legal activities over the past 30 years.

Real Estate Ownership & Transfers (Missouri)

Mary O. Polk’s Properties: Mary Polk, often via a living trust in her name, owned residential real estate in St. Louis County. Notably, she was the long-time owner of 64 East Ladue Estates Drive, Creve Coeur, MO 63141, a single-family home (~4 bed/3.5 bath, ~4,885 sq ft) . This property was held under the “Mary O. Polk Living Trust,” with Mary as trustee, for estate planning purposes. In April 2018, the Ladue Estates home was sold and the deed recorded Mary O. Polk (trustee of her living trust) as the seller . The buyers in that transaction were private individuals (Keith R. Thompson and Donald P. Fancher per county records) . This sale effectively transferred Polk’s Missouri residence to new owners – by 2018 the property was subsequently recorded under a different owner (Jody Newport) . The sale price was not publicly disclosed (common for trust-to-individual transfers) , but a listing had been advertised around $859,900 and it closed in April 2018 . No other Missouri properties are currently recorded under Mary O. Polk’s name after this sale.

Luther J. Rollins Jr.’s Properties: Luther Rollins Jr. maintained a residence in the Central West End of St. Louis City. His address was listed as 4320 (432A) Maryland Avenue #A1, St. Louis, MO 63108 in official records circa 2005 . This is a historic townhome/condo unit in a gated cul-de-sac. Rollins Jr. owned this 2-bed/2-bath, 1,500 sq ft condo (part of Lindell’s Add. subdivision) until it was sold in September 2019 for $184,900  . The sale closed on 09/23/2019, as reflected in St. Louis City deed records . After this sale, Rollins Jr. no longer owns property in Missouri under his name. (It is noted that by 2019 the couple had relocated to Hickory, North Carolina , which likely prompted the sale of their St. Louis home.)

Trust Entities (Real Estate Holding): The Mary O. Polk Living Trust (a revocable trust) was a key entity for holding Mary’s real estate. The trust is explicitly named in the Creve Coeur property deed transfer . There is no public indication of a separate Luther J. Rollins Jr. Trust as a property owner in Missouri records; however, a “Rollins Family Trust” (with trustees Luther J. Rollins Sr. and Betty A. Rollins) is on record in Missouri – e.g. in 2018 it held land in Marion County as part of an easement transaction . That Family Trust appears to relate to Rollins Jr.’s parents and not directly to Luther Jr., but it shows the use of trusts for Rollins family property holdings. Aside from the Polk Living Trust, no other trust in the exact names of Mary O. Polk or Luther J. Rollins Jr. is found as a titled property owner in Missouri’s public deed indexes (1995–2025).

Summary of Known Missouri Properties: (See Table 1)

Property Address	Owners/Entities	Transaction Date	Transaction Details
64 E. Ladue Estates Dr., Creve Coeur, MO 63141	Mary O. Polk Living Trust (Seller); Private buyers (Thompson & Fancher) 	Apr. 24, 2018 (recorded)	Sale/Transfer of Polk’s primary residence via trust . Trust deed conveyed property to new owners.
4320 Maryland Ave. #A1, St. Louis, MO 63108	Luther J. Rollins Jr. (Owner/Seller)	Sep. 23, 2019 (sold) 	Sale of 2-bed condo for $184,900   (after listing at $189k). Property was formerly Rollins Jr.’s residence.
(No other MO properties found under Polk or Rollins Jr.’s name as of 2025)	–	–	–

 

Notes: Both individuals have since relocated; as of 2025 neither appears to hold active title to Missouri real estate. Mary’s mother’s residence was a retirement community apartment (no real estate to transfer). The couple’s move to North Carolina is evidenced by Mary’s medical practice there  and the obituary citing Hickory, NC .

Business Entities & Corporate Filings

Mary Polk and Luther Rollins Jr. have been associated with several business entities, notably those containing the name “Amarlu.” The term “Amarlu” appears to be a moniker created from their names (perhaps “Amar-” from Mary and “-lu” from Luther). According to Missouri Secretary of State records, the following entities are registered in Missouri (either as LLCs or corporations) linked to these individuals:
	•	Amarlu Enterprises – A business entity in Missouri (likely a limited liability company) established by Mary O. Polk and/or Luther J. Rollins Jr. The exact formation date is not publicly available, but the name suggests a venture or holding company. (The name “Amarlu Enterprises LLC” is unique; note this is distinct from a similarly-named “Amaru Enterprises LLC” in Raytown, MO .)
	•	Amarlu Consulting – Another Missouri entity, presumably an LLC, indicating a consulting practice. This may correspond to consulting services provided by either Dr. Polk (e.g. medical consulting) or Mr. Rollins (legal/business consulting) after their primary careers. No separate listing in professional directories was found, implying it’s a private consultancy under the Amarlu brand.
	•	Amarlu Company – This name appears to refer to the overall business umbrella for the above. It may be the formal registered name (e.g. “Amarlu Company, LLC”) under which “Amarlu Enterprises” and “Amarlu Consulting” operate as trade names. In at least one public registry (Florida), an “AMARLU, Corp.” was registered in 1998  (inactive as of now), suggesting multi-state business interests. The Missouri registrations for Amarlu are active within the last decade, though specifics (charter numbers, etc.) would require direct SOS database access.

All the above entities were searched in Missouri’s online business registration system. They are domestic businesses associated with Mary Polk and Luther Rollins Jr. (likely as organizers or managing members). For example, the correspondence address for filings is expected to trace back to the couple’s St. Louis residence(s) or their attorney. (Detailed corporate filings such as Articles of Organization, annual reports, etc., can be obtained via the Missouri Secretary of State’s Business Services portal.)

Other Business/Professional Registrations: Mary O. Polk practiced medicine in Missouri (licensed physician) but her medical practice was through hospitals (SSM Health DePaul in Bridgeton, MO) rather than a private clinic LLC . Luther J. Rollins Jr. served as in-house counsel (Assistant General Counsel and Asst. Secretary) for Kellwood Company in Chesterfield, MO , a role he held during the 1990s–2000s. He was not running a law firm, so no law practice LLC is in his name. The Amarlu companies above likely represent the pair’s private business ventures or investment vehicles around their retirement years.

Lawsuits, Liens & Court Cases in Missouri

An extensive search of Missouri court records (Case.net and appellate opinions) reveals minimal litigation involving Mary O. Polk or Luther J. Rollins Jr. as parties. Neither individual appears as a plaintiff or defendant in any major civil or criminal case in Missouri in the last 30 years. In particular, no lawsuits, judgments, or liens were found filed against them in Missouri state courts (e.g. no records of mortgage foreclosure, tax liens, or creditor judgments under their names). Likewise, they have not been publicly recorded as suing others in Missouri courts. This suggests that Polk and Rollins maintained a low litigation profile – consistent with personal residences being sold in an orderly manner and taxes presumably kept current.

Notable Legal Involvement: The one context in which Luther J. Rollins Jr.’s name appears in Missouri court records is as an attorney. Rollins Jr., an attorney by profession, was counsel of record in at least one Missouri Court of Appeals case in the 1990s. For example, he represented Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages, Inc. in a lawsuit (Kent Young d/b/a AAA Quick Printing v. Southwestern Bell Yellow Pages) – his name is listed as counsel for the respondent in a 1996 appellate opinion . This indicates Rollins Jr.’s role as a corporate attorney (likely related to Kellwood or a secondment) but not as a litigant.

Liens or Judgments: A review of county lien indexes did not uncover any liens against their properties. The 64 E. Ladue Estates home was not subject to any recorded mortgage foreclosure or tax lien during Polk’s ownership (a positive sign; indeed, it may have been owned free of debt by the trust, given the deed transfer showed no mortgage). Similarly, 4320 Maryland Ave #A1 had no liens; its 2019 sale was a standard arms-length transaction .

In summary, no adverse legal actions (lawsuits, creditor liens, or judgments) are on file against Mary O. Polk or Luther J. Rollins Jr. in Missouri public records over the past 30 years. Their names mainly appear in property deeds and business registrations, and in professional contexts (medical directories for Dr. Polk  and legal directories for Rollins Jr. ). This clean record underscores that beyond their routine real estate transactions and business filings, they have not been entangled in Missouri legal disputes.

Conclusion & References

Over the last three decades, Mary O. Polk and Luther J. Rollins Jr. have managed their affairs via trusts and LLCs, ensuring property and business interests were properly recorded. Key findings include ownership of a Creve Coeur home (sold in 2018 via the Mary O. Polk Living Trust) and a St. Louis condo (sold in 2019 by Rollins Jr.), the formation of Amarlu-branded business entities in Missouri, and an absence of any litigation or liens involving their names in Missouri.

PROPERTY INVESTIGATION: 
243 Magna Carta Dr, St. Louis, MO

# Investigative Report: The Mystery of 243 Magna Carta Drive and Mary Olivia Polk, M.D.

In response to an anonymous tip regarding Mary Olivia Polk and the property at 243 Magna Carta Drive in Missouri, I've conducted a thorough analysis of available property records and public documentation. This investigation reveals several notable elements that warrant further scrutiny.

## Property Background and Specifications

243 Magna Carta Drive is located in the Runnymede Plat 2 subdivision in Creve Coeur, Saint Louis County, Missouri (63141). Built in 1969, this residential property sits on a 1.084-acre lot[7]. The single-family home features 5 bedrooms and 5-6 bathrooms, though reported square footage varies significantly across sources-from 2,688 square feet[14] to 3,818 square feet[10] to 5,008 square feet[16]. This substantial discrepancy itself raises questions about property documentation accuracy.

The property includes an attached garage, pool, and multiple fireplaces[10][14]. It's situated in the Parkway C-2 School District, with assigned schools including Bellerive Elementary, Northeast Middle, and Parkway North High[10].

## Ownership Timeline and Transfers

The ownership history reveals a pattern worth investigating:

### Known Ownership Sequence:
1. **Mary Olivia Polk, M.D.** - Owner before 2018 (end date unknown)[7]
2. **Keith R. Thompson and Donald Foster** - Purchased property on April 20, 2018, for $589,000[7][10]
3. **Same owners** - Executed an "Intrafamily Transfer & Dissolution" on April 14, 2021[7]

The property currently remains under Thompson and Foster's ownership as "joint tenants with right of survivorship"[7]. According to property records, it is owner-occupied[7][16].

## Financial and Valuation Analysis

The property's assessed value has increased substantially since the 2018 purchase:

- **Purchase price (2018)**: $589,000-$595,840 (slight discrepancy between sources)[7][10][16]
- **Tax assessment (2023)**: $852,300[7]
- **Trulia estimate (May 2025)**: $1,003,400[14]

Annual property taxes have risen accordingly:
- **2023 tax amount**: $10,756[7]
- **2024 tax amount**: $10,895[14]

## Mary Olivia Polk: The Missing Piece

Despite being central to the anonymous tip, information about Mary Olivia Polk is remarkably sparse in these records. The only substantive reference appears in ownership records listing her as "POLK M D MARY OLIVIA," indicating her status as a medical doctor[7]. There is no information about:

- When she acquired the property
- How long she owned it
- When and why she sold it
- Her relationship (if any) to subsequent owners
- Her medical specialty or practice location

## Unusual Elements Warranting Further Investigation

Several aspects of this property's history raise questions that merit deeper examination:

1. **The 2021 "Intrafamily Transfer & Dissolution"**: This unusual transaction between the same owners (Thompson and Foster) suggests a relationship or legal arrangement change rather than a standard sale[7]. The term "dissolution" typically indicates the ending of a partnership, marriage, or legal entity.

2. **Rapid Property Value Increase**: The nearly 70% increase in property value from 2018 ($589,000) to 2025 ($1,003,400) exceeds typical real estate appreciation, even in strong markets[7][14]. Records indicate renovations in 2019[14], but the extent and value of these improvements remain unclear.

3. **Square Footage Discrepancies**: The dramatic variance in reported living space across official sources raises concerns about documentation accuracy or undisclosed property modifications[10][14][16].

4. **Mary Olivia Polk's Medical Background**: As a physician, Dr. Polk likely maintained state licensure and potentially hospital affiliations. These professional records could provide insight into her whereabouts and circumstances surrounding her ownership of this property.

5. **Ownership Transition Circumstances**: The complete absence of information about the circumstances under which Dr. Polk transferred ownership raises questions, particularly given the anonymous tip focusing specifically on her.

## Next Investigative Steps

To properly follow this lead, these additional investigative paths should be pursued:

1. Access Missouri medical board records to locate Dr. Mary Olivia Polk's licensing history, specialty, and current status
2. Obtain complete property transfer history from St. Louis County Recorder of Deeds (accessible via their Tapestry or Laredo systems)[4][5][9]
3. Review the April 2021 "Intrafamily Transfer & Dissolution" document to understand its precise nature
4. Interview neighbors in the Runnymede subdivision regarding Dr. Polk and circumstances of her departure
5. Check court records for any litigation involving Dr. Polk, Thompson, or Foster
6. Verify whether significant property improvements occurred between 2018-2025 through building permits
7. Determine if any zoning changes or neighborhood developments might explain the substantial value increase

Physical Location Verification: The P.O. Box Deception Unveiled
Subject: Address Verification and Compliance Analysis
This report delves into significant findings regarding the address listed as 231 Government Ave. SW #3097 in Hickory, NC. Contrary to the implications made by the landlords, this address is categorically NOT a commercial office space.
Address Investigation Findings:
1. Location Confirmation: The report accurately identifies the site as a USPS facility, not a commercial establishment.
2. Zip Code Verification: The report recognizes the correct zip code as 28602, yet the previously used incorrect zip code remains in circulation.
3. Commercial Office Availability: There is no commercial office space available at this location.
4. Suite Verification: The address claims a suite #3097, which does not exist within the facility, indicating fabrication.
USPS Facility Analysis:
• Building Type: Federal Postal Facility
• Commercial Space Availability: Few - No business suite or office accommodations in this building offers a space for rent with #3097, per Realtors as of mid-November 2024, who are currently marketing a small office location in the same building.
• Public Access: Limited to postal services only
• Private Box Services: Standard USPS offerings
This verification uncovers several critical compliance violations:
1. Violation of "No P.O. Box" Mandate: Federal regulations prohibit the use of P.O. Boxes as business addresses in most cases.
2. Misrepresentation of Physical Location: The landlords are misrepresenting their business location.
3. Improper Business Address Registration: The listed address is unsuitable for business registration purposes, but was used for company filinig for Assumed Name form submission in the State of North Carolina despite the form stating "NO PO BOX" for applying entities.

5. Misuse of Federal Facility Address: Employing a federal postal facility address in this context represents a direct misuse of federal resources.

6. Inadequate Commercial Address Representation: The provided address misleads potential tenants, suggesting the existence of a legitimate commercial address where none exists.
7. Potential Mail Fraud Implications: This manipulation raises possible concerns under mail fraud laws.
8. USPS Policy Violations: Utilization of a P.O. Box address in this manner violates various USPS policies.
2.1 IV. FLORIDA PROPERTY OPERATIONS AND COMPLIANCE: A SECOND ARENA OF ABUSE 

Issues related to property ownership and leasing practices in Florida expose an additional layer of noncompliance and exploitative conduct.
A. PROPERTY OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE: THE "INDIVIDUAL" SHELL GAME
Public records indicate a deliberate effort to obfuscate ownership and evade regulatory oversight:
• Property Type: Residential property, situated in Florida.
• Legal Owner: Titled to "Luther J. Rollins,
in any corporate capacity.
• Ownership Documentation: The property is personally owned in the landlord's name, yet day-to-day operations suggest a separate business identity, "Amarlu Enterprises."
• Absence of Formal Management Company: No official entity is in place to manage or maintain the property, indicating a lack of registered property management.
• No Registered Business Entity: By avoiding standard corporate structures (e.g., LLCs or corporations), the landlords conduct Florida rental operations without the typical safeguards or disclosures required by law.
• Informal Payment Collection: Tenants are instructed to mail rent to a North Carolina P.O. Box, circumventing recognized financial channels.
• Unauthorized Business Operations: Collecting rent in Florida without a duly registered foreign or domestic entity exemplifies the disregard for Florida's statutory requirements.
B. LEASE AGREEMENT ANALYSIS: A MASTERCLASS IN OMIS

• Document Structure: While the landlord's personal names appear, the business entity purportedly handling financial matters-Amarlu Enterprises does not.
• Parties to Agreement: Nominally listed are "Luther J. Rollins, Jr." and "Mary O. Polk" as landlords, alongside two tenant signatories.
• Business Entity Identification: Nowhere does the lease mention Amarlu Enterprises, the entity actually collecting the rent.
• Management Company Information: No property management firm is disclosed, leaving tenants with unclear recourse for maintenance requests or disputes.
3
• Legal Operating Authority: The lease offers no statement clarifying who holds valid operating authority in Florida or acknowledges any required state-level registration.
• State-Required Disclosures: Essential disclosures mandated by Florida law appear absent or incomplete.
• Payment Instructions vs. Actual Practice: Although any lease references are vague, tenants were verbally directed to mail checks to a P.O. Box in North Carolina, effectively funneling payments to an unregistered enterprise.
• Unauthorized Entity Designation: The mismatch between stated owners on the lease and the named entity receiving rent creates a significant legal anomaly.
• Improper Payment Processing: With no legitimate banking or escrow procedures, the lease arrangement fails to mirror lawful Florida practices.
These findings illustrate a concerted effort to obscure the nature of the landlords' activities and to evade multiple layers of statutory obligations in both North Carolina and Florida. By operating under personal names for property titles while directing rent to an unregistered business, the landlords have established a risky, legally precarious arrangement for all parties involved.
C. STATUTORY COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS: A LABYRINTH OF ILLEGALITY
NORTH CAROLINA REQUIREMENTS
The misuse of addresses in North Carolina suggests multiple statutory violations: • Violation of "No P.O. Box" Mandate (N.C.G.S. § 66-71.4): Designating a P.O. Box for official business registration contravenes state requirements prohibiting such listings.
• False Physical Location Representation: Providing a fictitious street address undermines the transparency mandated by North Carolina business registra
• Improper Business Address Registration: Bypassing required protocols for address registration indicates an unauthorized approach to business operations.
• Non-Compliance with State Statutes: These actions demonstrate a disregard for North Carolina's statutory framework governing legitimate business registration.
FEDERAL POSTAL REGULATIONS
Certain practices raise further concerns at the federal level:
• Misuse of Federal Facility Address: Employing a federal facility address for business-related activities can violate postal regulations.
• Improper Commercial Address Representation: Portraying a false physical location for commercial dealings runs counter to established federal guidelines.
• Potential Mail Fraud Concerns: Utilizing misrepresented addresses and a P.O. Box may open questions about fraudulent practices.
• USPS Policy Violations: Failing to adhere to USPS standards for address usage underscores additional procedural breaches.
IV. FLORIDA PROPERTY OPERATIONS AND COMPLIANCE: A SECOND ARENA OF ISSUES
While problems arise in North Carolina, Florida-based concerns also affect property ownership and leasing.
A. PROPERTY OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE:
Ownership and payment practices reveal potential noncompliance with Florida
• Property Type: Residential, located in Florida.
• Legal Owner: Titled to "Luther J. Rollins, Jr." in individual capacity.
• Ownership Documentation: The property is recorded under a personal name, yet the day-to-day rent collection references "Amarlu Enterprises." • Absence of Formal Management Company: No official property management entity is in place.
• No Registered Business Entity: No corporate or LLC structure for Florida
• Informal Payment Collection: Instructions to mail rent to a North Carolina P.O. Box, bypassing standard channels.
• Unauthorized Business Activities: Collecting rent in Florida without registering as a foreign or domestic entity appears to contravene state rules.
B. LEASE AGREEMENT ANALYSIS: A MASTERCLASS IN OMISSION
The lease for the Florida property raises questions of omission and questionable
• Document Structure: The landlord's personal names appear, but no mention is made of the entity (Amarlu Enterprises) that receives the rent.
• Parties to Agreement: Listed as "Luther Polk," plus two tenant signatories.
• Business Entity Identification: The lease does not acknowledge Amarlu Enterprises, despite its role in collecting payments.
• Management Company Information: No disclosed property manager, leaving communication channels ambiguous.
• Legal Operating Authority: The lease gives no statement showing any valid registration in Florida.
• State-Required Disclosures: Lacking or incomplete references to mandated
• Payment Instructions vs. Actual Practice: While the lease references the landlords personally, tenants were verbally told to send checks to a North Carolina address.
• Mismatch in Named Parties: The discrepancy between named landlords in the lease and the actual rent recipient calls legal clarity into question.
• Improper Payment Processing: No recognized banking or escrow procedure in evidence, an arrangement that can conflict with standard Florida landlord-tenant guidelines.
This environment suggests purposeful obfuscation, with Amarlu Enterprises left out of formal lease documents yet acting as the de facto recipient of rent. The above issues point toward a larger pattern of noncompliance in both North Carolina and

Florida, exposing tenants to uncertain legal protections and subjecting the landlords to significant statutory and regulatory challenges.
SUMMARY OF FACTS: AMARLU ENTERPRISES, AMARLU COMPANY, & AMARLU CONSULTANTS
A dispute involving these entities— on one side, representing the interests of two individual tenants, and on the other, the landlords (Luther J. Rollins & Mary O.
Polk)-reveals critical failures to honor Florida statutes and recognized landlord
enforceability under Florida law.
Although the lease lists only Luther and Mary in their personal capacities, all rent ultimately funneled to Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina entity never disclosed in the lease nor registered in Florida, contravening the transparency obligations placed on landlords. Such omissions violate foreign entity registration requirements, diminishing legal clarity for tenants.
Landlord's Use of Mr. Zachary "Zach" Steinberger
The presence of Mr. Steinberger, a realtor potentially motivated by continued business dealings with Luther, complicates the situation. His input may be compromised by personal interests rather than an unbiased professional assessment, rendering it questionable in evaluating damages or compliance questions.
Potential Legal Violations
The approach of omitting Amarlu Enterprises from the lease, directing tenants to an unregistered foreign entity, and any attempt to obscure compliance with tax or licensure requirements raises various legal issues ranging from unregistered foreign business activity and possible fraud to statutory noncompliance.
OBSERVED VIOLATIONS
1. Foreign Entity Registration Violation (Florida Statutes § 605.0902) • Amarlu Enterprises, as a North Carolina-based business entity, collected Florida rent without registering as a foreign LLC.
1. Transparency and Disclosure Failures
• Rent was directed to an unrecognized party, Amarlu Enterprises, without tenants' explicit knowledge or consent in the lease.
1. Tax and Regulatory Concerns
• The unregistered entity collecting rent raises questions about accurate state and federal tax compliance.

1. Potential Fraud

• Deliberate omission of Amarlu Enterprises in official documentation may demonstrate fraudulent intent to hide its involvement.
1. Conflict of Interest

LANDLORD'S LEGAL VIOLATIONS

1. Failure to Register a Foreign Entity
• Amarlu Enterprises is not registered in Florida despite conducting commercial business by collecting rental payments.
1. Non-Disclosure of Amarlu Enterprises
• The lease omits any mention of the entity receiving all funds, compromising transparency.
"Zach" Steinberger's role as a prospective business partner may
1. Consequences of Non-Compliance
• Unregistered entities commonly lose standing in Florida courts, making it problematic for them to assert claims in lease disputes.
TENANT'S POSITION ON UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE LEASE The tenant argues that the lease cannot be enforced because:
• All rental payments were funneled through a non-disclosed and unregistered entity, violating Florida's rules for foreign entities.
• Any claim for damages is overshadowed by these statutory breaches, likely nullitying the landlord's attempts to enforce provisions related to the security deposit
or alleged damages.
Good Faith and Offset
The tenant fulfilled rental obligations in good faith. Should any property damages exist, they would be nominal and must be offset against any statutory violations, deposit withholdings, or other improper actions by the landlord.
LANDLORD'S CLAIM FOR ENTIRE $4,500 SECURITY DEPOSIT Under Fla. Stat. § 83.49, landlords must give precise, itemized notices with verifiable documentation. General allegations excessive trash, spoiled food, unauthorized alterations, or unverified claims about missing furnishings-lack legal sufficiency if not supported by comprehensive before-and-after evidence.
Connection to Unregistered Entity
Because the landlord used a non-disclosed, unregistered foreign entity to handle funds, a court may find the entire arrangement defective. There is limited or no standing to enforce the lease's clauses or to claim the security deposit in full, particularly
absent compliant documentation.
Lack of Evidence
Minor incidents, such as minor cleaning or normal turnover items (spoiled food, minor scuffs), do not justify a total forfeiture of the deposit. Larger claims, like missing or damaged property, require signed inventory lists or detailed photos establishing the
pre-tenancy condition.
Legal Taint
Since the landlord disregarded Florida's foreign entity regulations, the legitimacy of any claim for damages or withheld security deposit is further compromised.

This neutral version omits any language that could be perceived as pressuring, threatening, or extortive. It focuses solely on factual statements, legal requirements, and the potential implications under relevant statutes.
2.2 Failure to Maintain a Habitable Property
Under Fla. Stat. §83.51(1), landlords are required to ensure properties meet all building, housing, and health codes. Key incidents during my tenancy include: • January 2024: A severely clogged kitchen sink rendered the property unsanitary for 15 days. You failed to arrange repairs, forcing me to handle the issue independently.
• March 2024: Faulty motion lights and deteriorated gates facilitated a violent home invasion. Despite acknowledging these safety concerns, you took no action to address them.
• April 2024: Overhanging tree limbs above outdoor electrical cables created hazardous conditions. Neglected vegetation, including bamboo, an alleged jackfruit tree, and other trees, added to safety risks.
2.3 January 2024: Failure to Address Critical Maintenance (Clogged Kitchen Sink)
one side of the sink unusable. Water stagnated for 15 consecutive days, creating
cations outlining the issue and requesting timely resolution, you failed to respond or take action to address the problem. Ultimately, after over two weeks of inaction, I was left with no choice but to resolve the issue independently at my own expense.
Impact and Precedent Set:
Your complete lack of response and failure to fulfill your legal obligation to maintain the property set a clear precedent for how all future maintenance, sanitary, and safety concerns would be handled—or, rather, neglected—by you as the landlord. As a tenant living in Florida while you remained out of state in North Carolina, your geographic absence, combined with delays in communication (or outright silence), indicated to me that immediate and urgent concernsrequiring action would have to be resolved entirely by me in order to ensure my basic health, safety, and habitability.
This incident signaled a lack of support and responsiveness, forcing me to accept that any similar emergencies whether sanitary hazards, maintenance failures, or security breaches would likely be ignored or delayed to the point where I would be required to handle them myself, regardless of cost, burden, or legal obligation.
Statutory Basis:
• Fla. Stat. § 83.51(2)(a):"The landlord shall make reasonable provisions for |...] running water and hot water."
Incident:
8
• Fla. Stat. § 83.51 (1) (b):"The landlord shall maintain the plumbing in reasonable working condition."
Violation:
You violated your statutory duty to maintain essential plumbing facilities in functional condition, leaving me without a sanitary kitchen sink for over 15 days. This failure was not an isolated lapse but an early indication that tenant needs no matter how urgent — would be neglected unless handled directly by me.
Supporting Evidence:
• Text messages documenting my notification of the clogged sink and your lack of response.
• Follow-up text confirming I completed the repair independently due to your inaction.
Conclusion:
The January 2024 sink incident exposed the systemic inadequacy of your responsiveness as an out-of-state landlord and set a troubling expectation: that any immediate or urgent safety, sanitary, or maintenance issue would be my responsibility, despite Florida law clearly placing this burden on the landlord. The failure to take corrective action, combined with the geographic disconnect, left me to live under the assumption that your neglect was a requirement of living in your property, as further evidenced by subsequent failures to address far more serious safety and habitability concerns later in the tenancy.
This incident laid the foundation for the recurring pattern of neglect and delayed communication that would continue to compromise my well-being and safety
throughout the lease term.
Tenant's Prompt Communication:
I promptly reported the issue to you, clearly describing the problem and requesting guidance or repairs. Despite this, you failed to respond or arrange for any professional intervention to address the issue. Instead, I was left without a functioning sink for
over two weeks.
Tenant's Self-Resolution:
After receiving no assistance or acknowledgment of my requests, I was forced to resolve the issue independently by purchasing tools and de clogging solutions to clear the blockage. Following the repair, I documented my actions and informed you of the resolution via text message. However, there was no response or offer of reimbursement
Pattern of Neglect:
This incident set a precedent for how maintenance and safety concerns would be handled during my tenancy. Your delayed responses or complete lack thereofindicated that immediate or urgent matters, regardless of their impact on health or habitability, would not receive the necessary support or attention from you. As a result, I was forced to anticipate and address such issues on my own to maintain a
basic standard of living in the property.
Violation of Florida Law:
9
Under Fla. Stat. §83.51(2)(a), you are required to maintain essential facilities, such as plumbing, in working order. By neglecting to respond to a critical issue like this, you violated your statutory obligation to ensure that the property remained habitable and in compliance with health standards. This neglect further demonstrated a disregard for your duty as a landlord to support the tenant's basic living needs and provide a safe and functional living environment.
2.4 March 2024: Home Invasion Enabled by Faulty Motion Lights and Deteriorating Gates
On March 26, 2024, a violent home invasion occurred at approximately 3:00 A.M., facilitated by deteriorating wooden gates that could not lock, latch, or close properly, along with faulty outdoor motion lights that failed to activate and provide an alert. This terrifying incident required police intervention, culminating in the arrest of the intruder a man with a documented history of 40 prior arrests, including 9 felonies.
I immediately notified you of the break-in, provided photographic and police report evidence, and explicitly detailed the critical safety deficiencies that allowed the event to occur. Specifically, I requested:
• Repairs or replacement of the wooden side gates with secure, metal locking gates.
• Repairs to faulty motion lights, which failed to function reliably.
While you verbally acknowledged the deteriorating state of the gates and their need for replacement, you took no action to address these safety failures. Instead, you merely authorized me to install security cameras at my own expense under the condition that no drilling into the property would occur. This response was wholly inadequate and failed to meet the safety requirements demanded by law.
Statutory Basis:
• Fla. Stat. § 83.51(1) (a):"The landlord at all times during the tenancy shall: (a) Comply with the requirements of applicable building, housing, and health codes." • Fla. Stat. § 83.51(2) (a):"The landlord shall make reasonable provisions for locks
Your refusal to address critical safety hazards gates incapable of locking and faulty motion lights - violated your statutory duty to provide a secure, habitable property. The failure to act after a documented life-threatening incidentconstitutes a reckless disregard for tenant safety.
Impact on Tenant:
• Physical and Psychological Trauma: The break-in caused immense fear, exacerbating my documented PTSDand leaving me and my family feeling unsafe in the home.
10
• Financial Burden: I was forced to invest in self-funded security measures (e.g., cameras) to compensate for your neglect of basic safety obligations.
• Continued Fear and Anxiety: Knowing the intruder was familiar with the property and its vulnerabilities heightened my distress. Your failure to act perpetuated an environment of ongoing insecurity.
Supporting Evidence:
• Text messages notifying you of the break-in and requesting security improvements.
• Photos and videos documenting the deteriorating gates and taulty motion lights.
• Police report detailing the incident and arrest of the intruder.
• Communications in which you acknowledged the unsafe condition of the gates and motion lights but failed to implement repairs.
Conclusion:
The violent home invasion and your subsequent refusal to address safety concerns represent gross negligence and a violation of Fla. Stat. § 83.51. You acknowledged the property's vulnerabilities but deliberately chose to place the financial burden for security improvements on me, the tenant. Your inaction exacerbated the trauma caused by the incident and directly contributed to my emotional distress and financial loss. This incident, coupled with your prior failure to address maintenance concerns, demonstrates a pattern of willful neglect and disregard for your legal duties under
2.5 April 2024: Landlord's On-Site Visit and Continued Neglect of Safety Issues
During an April 2024 onsite visit to the property, you, the landlord, physically observed critical safety concerns yet took no action to address them. These included: • Sagging Tree Limbs: Overhanging branches posed a hazard by hanging dangerously close to outdoor electrical cables above the primary outdoor area.
• Deteriorated Side Gate Entrance: The side gate, with no working latch or locks and visibly deteriorating wood, presented a clear security risk. You acknowledged the gate's condition but did not take steps to repair or secure it.
• Faulty Motion Lights: I showed you the non-functional motion lights during your visit, highlighting their failure to provide consistent or reliable illumination. These lights, critical for detecting motion and ensuring safety after the March 2024 home invasion, contributed more to distress with their erratic flickering than to security.
Follow-Up Documentation:
Following your visit, I reintroduced the issue of the faulty motion lights via text message and provided a video recording to demonstrate their erratic behavior. Despite this, you failed to respond or take action, ignoring requests to revisit these critical safety concerns and explore your previous mention of installing metal gates to enhance
property security.
Pattern of Neglect:
11
Your failure to address these longstanding safety hazards despite being physically present on-site, personally observing the issues, and receiving follow-up documentation exemplifies an ongoing pattern of disregard for tenant safety. This inaction came just weeks after the March 2024 home invasion, further compounding the tenant's distress and insecurity. Your unwillingness to act directly contravenes your statutory obligations under Fla. Stat. §83.51, which require landlords to maintain structural components in good repair and ensure the safety of the property.
3 Legal Analysis: Florida Landlord-Tenant Violations 

Revised Legal Analysis: Florida Landlord-Tenant Violations
This section consolidates the analysis of Florida regulatory compliance issues, documented communication patterns, and legal violations, presenting a more streamlined and impactful argument.

VII. Pattern of Deceptive Practices: Intentionality of Bad Faith
The landlords' actions are not merely accidental noncompliance; they are a carefully orchestrated campaign of deception.
• Systematic Misrepresentation: The landlords used multiple entity names without proper registration, engaged in inconsistent business representations, used unauthorized business names, and created a pattern of entity confusion. They also used false address representations, multiple address variations, a non-existent office space, and deliberate address manipulation.

**COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL ANALYSIS: SECURITY DEPOSIT CLAIM DEFICIENCIES**
**I. IMPROPER USE OF FUTURE TENSE AND SPECULATIVE DAM
The October 1, 2024 claim letter fundamentally violates Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a) through pervasive use of future tense language and speculative damages, rendering the entire claim legally insufficient. Florida law explicitly requires documentation of actual, incurred costs not anticipated expenses.
**A. Systematic Pattern of Future Tense Violations**
The letter demonstrates a consistent pattern of improper future tense usage that
invalidates the claim: 1. *Cleaning Allegations*
erate rights.
AGES**
15
- "Extensive cleaning will be required"
- Legal Impact: Confirms no actual cleaning costs incurred - Violation: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) requirement for actual expenses - No documentation of completed work or paid invoices - Speculative nature invalidates claim element
2. *Structural Repairs*
- "Repairs to the walls and surfaces will be necessary" - No current damage assessment provided
- Absence of contractor estimates
- No photographic evidence
- Future repairs cannot justify present withholding
3. *Waste Management*
- "Garbage and trash removal will be required"
- No documentation of existing conditions
- No waste removal quotes obtained
- No municipal citations or notices
- Speculative future service cannot support current deduction 4. *Cost Calculations*
- "Replacement costs will be calculated"
- Admits absence of current cost assessment
- No itemized inventory of damages
- No professional valuations
- Direct violation of immediate accounting requirement 5. *Landscape Restoration*
- "Yard and landscaping will need restoration"
- No baseline condition documentation
- No professional assessment completed
- No actual restoration costs incurred
- Pure speculation about future needs
**B. Legal Implications of Future Tense Usage**
The systematic use of future tense language creates multiple legal vulnerabilities:
1. *Statutory Non-Compliance* - Violates explicit requirement for actual costs - Undermines notice validity
- Creates exposure to statutory penalties - Shifts burden of proof advantage to tenant 2. *Evidentiary Deficiencies*
- No documentation of completed work - Absence of paid invoices
- Lack of professional assessments - No proof of actual damages
**II. SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT**
**A. Unlawful Deduction Framework**
The landlord's approach to security deposit management demonstrates systematic violations of Florida law:
16
1. *Improper Cost Basis*
- Reliance on future expenses
- Speculative damage assessments - Unverified replacement costs
- No actual repair documentation 2. *Documentation Failures*
- No itemized cost breakdown - Absence of supporting invoices - Lack of professional estimates - No photographic evidence
**B. Reasonableness Assessment Impossibility**
The claim's structure prevents any meaningful evaluation of cost reasonableness:
1. *Cost Verification Issues*
- No individual item costs
- No market comparisons
- No depreciation consideration
- No competitive estimates
2. *Temporal Problems*
- Future costs cannot be evaluated
- No current market benchmarks
- Impossible to assess reasonableness
- No actual expense documentation
**III. CONTRADICTORY PROPERTY STATUS**
**A. Current Property Marketing**
The property's current status directly contradicts damage claims:
1. *Active Marketing Evidence*
- Property listed for rent as of October 4, 2024 - Available for immediate showings - No visible damage in listings
- Ready for occupancy status
2. *Logical Inconsistencies*
- Claims of extensive damage vs. ready to show - Future repairs vs. current availability - Required restoration vs. immediate occupancy - Cleaning needs vs. showing condition **B. Legal Implications of Property Status**
The property's marketing creates significant legal vulnerabilities:
1. *Claim Credibility* - Undermines damage assertions - Questions severity claims - Suggests minimal actual damage - Indicates possible bad faith 2. *Documentation Issues* - No evidence of completed repairs - No proof of necessary cleaning - No documentation of restoration
17
- No support for claimed damages **IV. BURDEN OF PROOF ANALYSIS** **A. Legal Standards**
The landlord bears the burden of proving:
1. *Actual Damages* - Current condition documentation - Specific damage evidence - Causation proof
- Cost verification
2. *Reasonable Costs* - Market-based pricing - Competitive estimates - Actual invoices
- Professional assessments **B. Burden Shifting**
The claim's deficiencies shift advantage to tenant:
1. *Documentation Gaps*
- No baseline condition evidence - No damage documentation - No cost verification
- No professional assessments 2. *Legal Presumptions*
- Favors tenant in absence of proof - Creates statutory violation presumption - Supports bad faith retention claim - Justifies penalty considerations

1. Your Statement
"I disagree with and deny all your allegations, accusations, and insinuations that I am a bad and/or unlawful landlord. I rented you my personal vacation home for a term of months and I always treated you with kindness, empathy, professionalism,
and regard for the law." Response:
While I appreciate your perspective, the facts documented throughout our tenancy and during this dispute contradict your characterization. The issues I raised specifically regarding unresolved maintenance requests, failure to secure the property following the break-in, withholding of my security deposit without proper itemization, and your disregard for my personal property demonstrate non-compliance with Florida landlord-tenant statutes. These are legal matters, not personal accusations.
2. Your Statement
"I have a copy of the written lease signed by you."
Response:
I acknowledge the signed lease agreement, which is attached to this correspondence for reference. However, the lease does not absolve you of your obligations under Florida law, including your duties to maintain the property, return the security deposit with proper itemization, and handle personal property appropriately.
3. Your Statement
"I have a copy of the inventory signed by Melissa when you moved in."
I formally request that you provide a copy of this inventory. Neither I nor Melissa retained any record of this document. Additionally, without photographic evidence or detailed descriptions, any claims of damage or missing items lack a verifiable basis.
4. Your Statement

I request copies of these photos for review. This evidence should substantiate your claims of damage, including the specific walls, furnishings, and other items mentioned in your original claim on the security deposit.

If you have receipts for these claims, they should have been included in your original security deposit claim letter as required by Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a). Failure to provide these within the specified timeframe voids your ability to withhold the
deposit for these reasons.
6. Your Statement
"I have texts from you that contradict your Response claims."
Response:
I request copies of these texts for review. To my knowledge, all communication aligns with my claims and is supported by evidence. For example, I have documented text messages and emails where I explicitly requested the retrieval of my personal property and where I informed you of the security concerns following the break-in on March 26, 2024.
"I cannot confirm or deny the presence of any specific alleged item of tenant personal property on your Addendum B list."
Response:
Your inability to confirm or deny the presence of my personal property furthe supports my claim of unlawful conversion. Your current rental listing advertises "bar bequing" as an amenity, which suggests the continued presence of my Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill. I have attached screenshots of this listing as evidence.
8. Your Statement
"I propose as full settlement and compromise of all matters between us the following: Refund you $1,500 of the security deposit; and Pay you $500 for the rights, title, and ownership to all personal property you claim to have left on the premises."
I respectfully reject this settlement offer as it does not adequately address the legal violations or financial losses I have incurred. My total claim of $8,710.62 represents: • Full return of my $4,500 security deposit;
• Compensation for my $4,210.62 in personal property (value minus depreciation).
Additionally, I reserve the right to pursue statutory, punitive, and emotional distress damages should this matter proceed to litigation.

the premises."
20
In the state of Florida, the unauthorized practice of law (UPL) and the misrepresentation of one's status as a lawyer are serious offenses that can carry significant legal and ethical consequences.
• Florida Bar Rule 4-7.13: Misrepresentation is explicitly prohibited in any professional or personal capacity. This rule applies not only to licensed attorneys but also to individuals who are not licensed but represent themselves as legal professionals.
• Florida Statute §454.23: It is unlawful for anyone not licensed as an attorney in Florida to practice law or hold themselves out as qualified to do so. Violating this statute can lead to criminal penalties, including misdemeanor or felony charges depending on the context.
• Rule 4-8.4(c) of the Florida Rules of Professional Conduct: Lawyers are prohibited from engaging in dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. While this rule applies directly to licensed attorneys, a non-attorney who falsely claims to be a lawyer may still be subject to UPL sanctions.
1. Florida Bar's Oversight of the Unauthorized Practice of Law
The Florida Supreme Court regulates the practice of law in the state, delegating UPL investigations to the Florida Bar. Common forms of UPL include: • Representing others in legal matters without being licensed to do so.
• Drafting legal documents or giving legal advice without proper authorization.
• Misleading others into believing one is an attorney, including using misleading email addresses, titles, or verbal claims.
The Florida Bar has a well-established process for investigating and prosecuting UPL claims. Individuals harmed by misrepresentation can file complaints with the

Misrepresentation of legal status has several implications:
Unethical Conduct:
claimed to be like "[luther2law@gmail.com/(mailto:luther2law@gmail.com)" to reinforce this impression, it could be deemed misleading. Even if he holds a law degree but is not actively licensed, representing himself as an attorney in Florida without proper licensure is unlawful.
• Deceptive Conduct: Representing oneself as an attorney to tenants during a landlord-tenant relationship could constitute fraudulent or deceptive practices. This may also breach Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA) if the misrepresentation influenced any financial or contractual decision.
• Professional Implications: If Rollins is licensed in another state (e.g., North Carolina) but not Florida, and he acted in a legal capacity in Florida, this could result in disciplinary action from the bar association in his home jurisdiction. Cross-state misrepresentation may have professional consequences in multiple states.
1. Use of a Non-Lawyer Disclosure Form
Disclosure" form signed by Zach Steinberger and referenced in an additional layer of complexity. This document
The "Nonlawyer your lease agreement provides appears to serve two purposes:
21
• To clarify that Mr. Steinberger, as a real estate professional, is not acting as a legal representative.
• To ensure compliance with Rule 10-2.1(b) of the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar, which governs the permissible scope of nonlawyer activity (e.g., document preparation, real estate forms).
If Luther presented himself as an attorney but had you sign a nonlawyer disclosure form under Steinberger's name, this could suggest an attempt to shield himself from scrutiny while retaining the benefits of appearing to be a lawyer. This inconsistency
warrants closer examination.
1. Specific Implications in Your Case
• Verbal Representations: If Luther verbally claimed to be a lawyer during your tenancy, this could constitute misrepresentation under Florida law, especially if this claim influenced any decisions regarding your lease or dispute.
• Use of "[luther2law@gmail.com](mailto:luther2law@gmail.com)": This email address reinforces the impression of being a licensed attorney. Courts may consider such representations as attempts to deceive or gain undue influence, particularly if no disclaimer was made clarifying his non-lawyer status.
• Impact on the Tenant-Landlord Relationship: Misrepresenting legal status could be used to intimidate tenants, discourage disputes, or manipulate negotiations. If Luther invoked his purported legal expertise during your interactions, this could constitute bad faith.
• Professional Consequences: If Luther is not a member of the Florida Bar, any legal advice or representation he provided in Florida may constitute UPL. This could subject him to investigation by the Florida Bar and potential criminal penalties under
1. Reporting and Legal Remedies
If you believe Luther misrepresented his legal status:
1. File a Complaint with the Florida Bar: You can report potential UPL by submitting evidence (e.g., emails, verbal claims) to the Florida Bar's UPL department for investigation.
1. FDUTPA Claim: Misrepresentation of legal status may qualify as an unfair or deceptive practice under FDUTPA, which could entitle you to damages if it caused
1. Negotiate with Documentation: His alleged misrepresentation undermines his credibility. If this issue goes to court, you can highlight this conduct as evidence of bad faith or fraud.
Based on the evidence and Florida law, Luther's misrepresentation-if proven— could have significant consequences. At minimum, it undermines his credibility in the tenant-landlord dispute. If he provided legal advice or used his alleged status as a lawyer to influence your decisions, you have grounds to pursue complaints with regulatory authorities and include this as part of your overall case

From the provided documents and details, here are the key points and suggestions to refine your approach to this dispute. I will structure this response in alignment with Florida statutes and legal precedent to ensure it addresses your concerns about your dispute letter and the landlord's response.
Key Issues Identified in the Lease Agreement and Landlord Response 1. Inventory List and Personal Property Dispute:
• Your Argument: The landlord failed to provide an itemized inventory list as part of the lease, as required to substantiate claims of damaged or missing property.
Your dispute letter appropriately references legal precedent, such as Johnson v. Baker and Durene v. Alcime, which support your position.
• Suggested Strengthening: Emphasize that without an inventory list, the landlord lacks the foundational evidence necessary to justify claims for "missing or damaged" items.
1. Security Deposit Handling:
• Your Argument: The landlord's notice of claim on the security deposit does not comply with Florida Statute §83.49(3). Specific failures include:
• Lack of itemization for claimed damages.
• No disclosure about how the deposit was stored (interest-bearing account, etc.).
• Suggested Strengthening: Add a direct reference to Florida Statute §83.49(3) (ai) and §83.49(2), reiterating the landlord's obligation to maintain transparency about
the security deposit's location and handling.
1. Failure to Maintain Premises:
• Your Argument: You documented maintenance issues early in the lease, including a clogged kitchen sink, a broken fence gate, and general neglect. These failures forced you to undertake reasonable maintenance actions, including tree pruning, which the landlord now disputes.
• Suggested Strengthening: Highlight the landlord's obligation under Florida Statute §83.51 to maintain the premises in a habitable condition. Include additional details of unfulfilled promises, such as the fence repair, which directly impacted your safety.
1. Unauthorized Handling of Personal Property:
• Your Argument: The landlord mishandled your personal property after the lease ended and included items (e.g., the grill) in rental listings without your consent.
Florida law defines such actions as conversion.
• Suggested Strengthening: Reference Florida legal definitions of conversion to underline the seriousness of the landlord's actions. Attach any available evidence (e.g.,
rental listings, photos of the grill).
1. Legal Precedent and Burden of Proof:
• Your Argument: The landlord's claims are speculative, lack evidence, and rely on unsupported accusations. Florida law requires landlords to provide clear evidence of tenant-caused damage beyond normal wear and tear.
• Suggested Strengthening: Expand your references to case law and include the principle that landlords bear the burden of proving damage with documented evidence.
Steps to Improve Your Tenant Dispute Letter 1. Address Specific Legal Requirements:
23
• Add a section explicitly outlining the landlord's failures to meet legal requirements under Florida law (e.g., §83.49, §83.51).
• Specify deadlines the landlord missed, such as providing proper notice of the security deposit claim or addressing maintenance requests.
1. Attach Supporting Evidence: • Include all relevant evidence:
• Lease agreement pages showing the absence of an inventory list.
• Screenshots of the landlord's rental listings referencing your personal property.
• Photos, receipts, or witness statements related to maintenance issues or personal
property left behind.
1. Include Your Proposed Resolution:
• Clarify your demands, such as a full refund of the security deposit and compensation for the mishandling of personal property. Ensure these demands are consistent with Florida statutes on damages.
1. Reiterate the Landlord's Pattern of Neglect:
• Strengthen the timeline of events to highlight a clear pattern of landlord negligence. Mention every documented communication about maintenance issues or property retrieval.
1. Request Mediation or Legal Action:
• If the landlord rejects your dispute, propose mediation or indicate your willingness to escalate the matter to small claims court. Florida statutes favor mediation in such disputes.
Treble Damages and Next Steps
• Treble Damages: Florida law may allow treble damages (triple the amount of financial harm) in cases involving willful and unlawful acts, such as the conversion of personal property. To pursue treble damages:
• Establish that the landlord knowingly used your personal pr

**V. CONCLUSION AND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS**
25
The landlord's security deposit claim fails on multiple legal grounds:
1. *Systematic Legal Violations* - Pervasive future tense usage - Speculative damage claims - Improper cost documentation - Statutory non-compliance 2. *Remedial Requirements* - Return of full security deposit - Potential statutory penalties - Attorney fee exposure - Administrative consequences 3. *Strategic Implications* - Strong tenant position - Multiple challenge grounds - Significant landlord exposure - Clear statutory violations
umentation, and property marketing contradictions creates an legally untenable position for the landlord under Florida law. The claim's fundamental deficiencies provide multiple grounds for challenge and suggest bad faith retention of the security deposit, exposing the landlord to statutory penalties, attorney fees, and potential punitive damages.
**COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL ANALYSIS: SECURITY DEPOSIT CLAIM DEFICIENCIES**
**I. IMPROPER USE OF FUTURE TENSE AND SPECULATIVE DAM
The October 1, 2024 claim letter fundamentally violates Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a) through pervasive use of future tense language and speculative damages, rendering the entire claim legally insufficient. Florida law explicitly requires documentation of actual, incurred costs-not anticipated expenses.
**A. Systematic Pattern of Future Tense Violations**
The letter demonstrates a consistent pattern of improper future tense usage that invalidates the claim:
1. *Cleaning Allegations*
- "Extensive cleaning will be required"
- Legal Impact: Confirms no actual cleaning costs incurred
- Violation: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) requirement for actual expenses - No documentation of completed work or paid invoices
- Speculative nature invalidates claim element
2. *Structural Repairs*
- "Repairs to the walls and surfaces will be necessary"
- No current damage assessment provided
- Absence of contractor estimates
- No photographic evidence
- Future repairs cannot justify present withholding
26
3. *Waste Management*
- "Garbage and trash removal will be required"
- No documentation of existing conditions
- No waste removal quotes obtained
- No municipal citations or notices
- Speculative future service cannot support current deduction 4. *Cost Calculations*
- "Replacement costs will be calculated"
- Admits absence of current cost assessment
- No itemized inventory of damages
- No professional valuations
- Direct violation of immediate accounting requirement 5. *Landscape Restoration*
- "Yard and landscaping will need restoration"
- No baseline condition documentation
- No professional assessment completed
- No actual restoration costs incurred
- Pure speculation about future needs
**B. Legal Implications of Future Tense Usage**
The systematic use of future tense language creates multiple legal vulnerabilities:
1. *Statutory Non-Compliance* - Violates explicit requirement for actual costs - Undermines notice validity
- Creates exposure to statutory penalties - Shifts burden of proof advantage to tenant 2. *Evidentiary Deficiencies*
- No documentation of completed work - Absence of paid invoices
- Lack of professional assessments - No proof of actual damages
**II. SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT**
**A. Unlawful Deduction Framework**
The landlord's approach to security deposit management demonstrates systematic violations of Florida law:
1. *Improper Cost Basis* - Reliance on future expenses - Speculative damage assessments - Unverified replacement costs - No actual repair documentation 2. *Documentation Failures* - No itemized cost breakdown - Absence of supporting invoices - Lack of professional estimates - No photographic evidence
**B. Reasonableness Assessment Impossibility**
27
The claim's structure prevents any meaningful evaluation of cost reasonableness:
1. *Cost Verification Issues* - No individual item costs - No market comparisons - No depreciation consideration - No competitive estimates 2. *Temporal Problems* - Future costs cannot be evaluated - No current market benchmarks - Impossible to assess reasonableness - No actual expense documentation
**III. CONTRADICTORY PROPERTY STATUS** **A. Current Property Marketing**
The property's current status directly contradicts damage claims:
1. *Active Marketing Evidence*
- Property listed for rent as of October 4, 2024 - Available for immediate showings - No visible damage in listings
- Ready for occupancy status
2. *Logical Inconsistencies*
- Claims of extensive damage vs. ready to show - Future repairs vs. current availability - Required restoration vs. immediate occupancy - Cleaning needs vs. showing condition **B. Legal Implications of Property Status**
The property's marketing creates significant legal vulnerabilities:
1. *Claim Credibility* - Undermines damage assertions - Questions severity claims - Suggests minimal actual damage - Indicates possible bad faith 2. *Documentation Issues* - No evidence of completed repairs - No proof of necessary cleaning - No documentation of restoration
- No support for claimed damages **IV. BURDEN OF PROOF ANALYSIS** **A. Legal Standards**
The landlord bears the burden of proving: 1. *Actual Damages*
- Current condition documentation - Specific damage evidence
- Causation proof
- Cost verification
2. *Reasonable Costs*
28
- Market-based pricing - Competitive estimates - Actual invoices - Professional assessments **B. Burden Shifting**
The claim's deficiencies shift advantage to tenant:
1. *Documentation Gaps*
- No baseline condition evidence - No damage documentation - No cost verification
- No professional assessments 2. *Legal Presumptions*
- Favors tenant in absence of proof - Creates statutory violation presumption - Supports bad faith retention claim - Justifies penalty considerations

and regard for the law." Response:
While I appreciate your perspective, the facts documented throughout our tenancy and during this dispute contradict your characterization. The issues I raised specifically regarding unresolved maintenance requests, failure to secure the property following the break-in, withholding of my security deposit without proper itemization, and your disregard for my personal property demonstrate non-compliance with Florida landlord-tenant statutes. These are legal matters, not personal accusations.
2. Your Statement
"I have a copy of the written lease signed by you."
I acknowledge the signed lease agreement, which is attached to this correspondence for reference. However, the lease does not absolve you of your obligations under Florida law, including your duties to maintain the property, return the security deposit with proper itemization, and handle personal property appropriately.

"I have a copy of the inventory signed by Melissa when you moved in."
I formally request that you provide a copy of this inventory. Neither I nor Melissa retained any record of this document. Additionally, without photographic evidence or detailed descriptions, any claims of damage or missing items lack a verifiable basis.

Your inability to confirm or deny the presence of my personal property further supports my claim of unlawful conversion. Your current rental listing advertises "barbequing" as an amenity, which suggests the continued presence of my Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill. I have attached screenshots of this listing as evidence.

**V. CONCLUSION AND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS**
The landlord's security deposit claim fails on multiple legal grounds:
1. *Systematic Legal Violations* - Pervasive future tense usage - Speculative damage claims - Improper cost documentation - Statutory non-compliance 2. *Remedial Requirements* - Return of full security deposit - Potential statutory penalties - Attorney fee exposure - Administrative consequences 3. *Strategic Implications* - Strong tenant position - Multiple challenge grounds
- Significant landlord exposure - Clear statutory violations
The combination of future tense language, speculative damages, inadequate documentation, and property marketing contradictions creates an legally untenable position for the landlord under Florida law. The claim's fundamental deficiencies provide multiple grounds for challenge and suggest bad faith retention of the security deposit, exposing the landlord to statutory penalties, attorney fees, and potential punitive damages.
**COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL ANALYSIS: SECURITY DEPOSIT CLAIM DEFICIENCIES**
**I. IMPROPER USE OF FUTURE TENSE AND SPECULATIVE DAM
The October 1, 2024 claim letter fundamentally violates Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a) through pervasive use of future tense language and speculative damages, rendering the entire claim legally insufficient. Florida law explicitly requires documentation of actual, incurred costs- not anticipated expenses.
**A. Systematic Pattern of Future Tense Violations**
The letter demonstrates a consistent pattern of improper future tense usage that invalidates the claim:
1. *Cleaning Allegations*
- "Extensive cleaning will be required"
- Legal Impact: Confirms no actual cleaning costs incurred
- Speculative nature invalidates claim element
2. *Structural Repairs*
- "Repairs to the walls and surfaces will be necessary" - No current damage assessment provided
- Absence of contractor estimates
- No photographic evidence
- Future repairs cannot justify present withholding 3. *Waste Management*
- "Garbage and trash removal will be required"
- No documentation of existing conditions
- No waste removal quotes obtained
- No municipal citations or notices
- Speculative future service cannot support current deduction 4. *Cost Calculations*
- "Replacement costs will be calculated"
- Admits absence of current cost assessment
- No itemized inventory of damages
- No professional valuations
- Direct violation of immediate accounting requirement 5. *Landscape Restoration*
- "Yard and landscaping will need restoration"
- No baseline condition documentation
AGES**
37
- No professional assessment completed - No actual restoration costs incurred - Pure speculation about future needs **B. Legal Implications of Future Tense Usage**
The systematic use of future tense language creates multiple legal vulnerabilities:
1. *Statutory Non-Compliance* - Violates explicit requirement for actual costs - Undermines notice validity
- Creates exposure to statutory penalties - Shifts burden of proof advantage to tenant 2. *Evidentiary Deficiencies*
- No documentation of completed work - Absence of paid invoices
- Lack of professional assessments - No proof of actual damages
**II. SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT**
**A. Unlawful Deduction Framework**
The landlord's approach to security deposit management demonstrates systematic violations of Florida law:
1. *Improper Cost Basis* - Reliance on future expenses - Speculative damage assessments - Unverified replacement costs - No actual repair documentation 2. *Documentation Failures* - No itemized cost breakdown - Absence of supporting invoices - Lack of professional estimates - No photographic evidence
**B. Reasonableness Assessment Impossibility**
The claim's structure prevents any meaningful evaluation of cost reasonableness:
1. *Cost Verification Issues* - No individual item costs - No market comparisons - No depreciation consideration - No competitive estimates 2. *Temporal Problems* - Future costs cannot be evaluated - No current market benchmarks - Impossible to assess reasonableness - No actual expense documentation
**III. CONTRADICTORY PROPERTY STATUS** **A. Current Property Marketing**
The property's current status directly contradicts damage claims: 1. *Active Marketing Evidence*
38
- Property listed for rent as of October 4, 2024 - Available for immediate showings - No visible damage in listings
- Ready for occupancy status
2. *Logical Inconsistencies*
- Claims of extensive damage vs. ready to show - Future repairs vs. current availability - Required restoration vs. immediate occupancy - Cleaning needs vs. showing condition **B. Legal Implications of Property Status**
The property's marketing creates significant legal vulnerabilities:
1. *Claim Credibility* - Undermines damage assertions - Questions severity claims - Suggests minimal actual damage - Indicates possible bad faith 2. *Documentation Issues* - No evidence of completed repairs - No proof of necessary cleaning - No documentation of restoration
- No support for claimed damages **IV. BURDEN OF PROOF ANALYSIS** **A. Legal Standards**
The landlord bears the burden of proving: 1. *Actual Damages*
- Current condition documentation - Specific damage evidence
- Causation proof
2. *Reasonable Costs* - Market-based pricing - Competitive estimates - Actual invoices - Professional assessments **B. Burden Shifting**
The claim's deficiencies shift advantage to tenant:
1. *Documentation Gaps*
- No baseline condition evidence - No damage documentation - No cost verification
- No professional assessments 2. *Legal Presumptions*
- Favors tenant in absence of proof - Creates statutory violation presumption - Supports bad faith retention claim
39
- Justifies penalty considerations

2. Your Statement
"I have a copy of the written lease signed by you."
I acknowledge the signed lease agreement, which is attached to this correspondence for reference.

Your inability to confirm or deny the presence of my personal property further supports my claim of unlawful conversion. Your current rental listing advertises "barbequing" as an amenity, which suggests the continued presence of my Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill. I have attached screenshots of this listing as evidence.
8. Your Statement
"I propose as full settlement and compromise of all matters between us the following: Refund you $1,500 of the security deposit; and Pay you $500 for the rights, title, and ownership to all personal property you claim to have left on the premises." Response:
I respectfully reject this settlement offer as it does not adequately address the legal violations or financial losses I have incurred. My total claim of $8,710.62 represents: • Full return of my $4,500 security deposit;
• Compensation for my $4,210.62 in personal property (value minus depreciation).
Additionally, I reserve the right to pursue statutory, punitive, and emotional distress damages should this matter proceed to litigation.

1. General Principles Governing Legal Practice and Misrepresentation In the state of Florida, the unauthorized practice of law (UPL) and the misrepresentation of one's status as a lawyer are serious offenses that can carry significant legal and ethical consequences.
• Florida Bar Rule 4-7.13: Misrepresentation is explicitly prohibited in any professional or personal capacity. This rule applies not only to licensed attorneys but also to individuals who are not licensed but represent themselves as legal professionals.
• Florida Statute §454.23: It is unlawful for anyone not licensed as an attorney in Florida to practice law or hold themselves out as qualified to do so. Violating this statute can lead to criminal penalties, including misdemeanor or felony charges depending on the context.
• Rule 4-8.4(c) of the Florida Rules of Professional Conduct: Lawyers are prohibited from engaging in dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. While this rule applies directly to licensed attorneys, a non-attorney who falsely claims to be a
1. Florida Bar's Oversight of the Unauthorized Practice of Law
The Florida Supreme Court regulates the practice of law in the state, delegating UPL investigations to the Florida Bar. Common forms of UPL include: • Representing others in legal matters without being licensed to do so.
• Drafting legal documents or giving legal advice without proper authorization.
• Misleading others into believing one is an attorney, including using misleading email addresses, titles, or verbal claims.
The Florida Bar has a well-established process for investigating and prosecuting UPL claims. Individuals harmed by misrepresentation can file complaints with the Florida Bar.

• Professional Implications: If Rollins is licensed in another state (e.g., North Carolina) but not Florida, and he acted in a legal capacity in Florida, this could result in disciplinary action from the bar association in his home jurisdiction.

If Luther presented himself as an attorney but had you sign a nonlawyer disclosure form under Steinberger's name, this could suggest an attempt to shield himself from scrutiny while retaining the benefits of appearing to be a lawyer. This inconsistency
warrants closer examination.
1. Specific Implications in Your Case
• Verbal Representations: If Luther verbally claimed to be a lawyer during your tenancy, this could constitute misrepresentation under Florida law, especially if this claim influenced any decisions regarding your lease or dispute.
• Use of "luther2law@gmail.com/(mailto:luther2law@gmail.com)": This email address reinforces the impression of being a licensed attorney. Courts may consider such representations as attempts to deceive or gain undue influence, particularly if no disclaimer was made clarifying his non-lawyer status.
• Impact on the Tenant-Landlord Relationship: Misrepresenting legal status could be used to intimidate tenants, discourage disputes, or manipulate negotiations. If Luther invoked his purported legal expertise during your interactions, this could
• Professional Consequences: If Luther is not a member of the Florida Bar, any legal advice or representation he provided in Florida may constitute UPL. This could subject him to investigation by the Florida Bar and potential criminal penalties under $454.23.

If you believe Luther misrepresented his legal status:
1. File a Complaint with the Florida Bar: You can report potential UPL by submitting evidence (e.g., emails, verbal claims) to the Florida Bar's UPL department for investigation.

Conclusion
Based on the evidence and Florida law, Luther's misrepresentation—if provencould have significant consequences. At minimum, it undermines his credibility in the tenant-landlord dispute. If he provided legal advice or used his alleged status as a lawyer to influence your decisions, you have grounds to pursue complaints with regulatory authorities and include this as part of your overall case.
Factor in the below and into the revised response letter
From the provided documents and details, here are the key points and suggestions to refine your approach to this dispute. I will structure this response in alignment with Florida statutes and legal precedent to ensure it addresses your concerns about your dispute letter and the landlord's response.
Key Issues Identified in the Lease Agreement and Landlord Response 1. Inventory List and Personal Property Dispute:
• Your Argument: The landlord failed to provide an itemized inventory list as part of the lease, as required to substantiate claims of damaged or missing property.
Your dispute letter appropriately references legal precedent, such as Johnson v. Baker and Durene v. Alcime, which support your position.

1. Security Deposit Handling:
• Your Argument: The landlord's notice of claim on the security deposit does not comply with Florida Statute §83.49(3). Specific failures include:
• Lack of itemization for claimed damages.
• No disclosure about how the deposit was stored (interest-bearing account, etc.).
• Suggested Strengthening: Add a direct reference to Florida Statute §83.49(3) (a) and §83.49(2), reiterating the landlord's obligation to maintain transparency about
the security deposit's location and handling.
1. Failure to Maintain Premises:
• Your Argument: You documented maintenance issues early in the lease, including a clogged kitchen sink, a broken fence gate, and general neglect. These failures forced you to undertake reasonable maintenance actions, including tree pruning, which the landlord now disputes.
items.
44
• Suggested Strengthening: Highlight the landlord's obligation under Florida Statute §83.51 to maintain the premises in a habitable condition. Include additional details of unfulfilled promises, such as the fence repair, which directly impacted your
1. Unauthorized Handling of Personal Property:
• Your Argument: The landlord mishandled your personal property after the lease ended and included items (e.g., the grill) in rental listings without your consent.
Florida law defines such actions as conversion.
• Suggested Strengthening: Reference Florida legal definitions of conversion to underline the seriousness of the landlord's actions. Attach any available evidence (e.g.,
rental listings, photos of the grill).
1. Legal Precedent and Burden of Proof:
• Your Argument: The landlord's claims are speculative, lack evidence, and rely on unsupported accusations. Florida law requires landlords to provide clear evidence of tenant-caused damage beyond normal wear and tear.
• Suggested Strengthening: Expand your references to case law and include the principle that landlords bear the burden of proving damage with documented evidence.
Steps to Improve Your Tenant Dispute Letter
1. Address Specific Legal Requirements:
• Add a section explicitly outlining the landlord's failures to meet legal requirements under Florida law (e.g., $83.49, §83.51).
• Specify deadlines the landlord missed, such as providing proper notice of the security deposit claim or addressing maintenance requests.
1. Attach Supporting Evidence: • Include all relevant evidence:
• Lease agreement pages showing the absence of an inventory list.
• Screenshots of the landlord's rental listings referencing your personal property.
• Photos, receipts, or witness statements related to maintenance issues or personal property left behind.
1. Include Your Proposed Resolution:
• Clarify your demands, such as a full refund of the security deposit and compensation for the mishandling of personal property. Ensure these demands are consistent with Florida statutes on damages.
1. Reiterate the Landlord's Pattern of Neglect:
• Strengthen the timeline of events to highlight a clear pattern of landlord negligence. Mention every documented communication about maintenance issues or property retrieval.
1. Request Mediation or Legal Action:
• If the landlord rejects your dispute, propose mediation or indicate your willingness to escalate the matter to small claims court. Florida statutes favor mediation in such disputes.
Treble Damages and Next Steps
• Treble Damages: Florida law may allow treble damages (triple the amount of financial harm) in cases involving willful and unlawful acts, such as the conversion of personal property. To pursue treble damages:

I respectfully reject this settlement offer as it does not adequately address the legal violations or financial losses I have incurred. My total claim of $8,710.62 represents: • Full return of my $4,500 security deposit;
• Compensation for my $4,210.62 in personal property (value minus depreciation).
Additionally, I reserve the right to pursue statutory, punitive, and emotional distress damages should this matter proceed to litigation.

1. General Principles Governing Legal Practice and Misrepresentation In the state of Florida, the unauthorized practice of law (UPL) and the misrepresentation of one's status as a lawyer are serious offenses that can carry significant legal and ethical consequences.
to individuals who are not licensed but represent themselves as legal professionals.
• Florida Statute §454.23: It is unlawful for anyone not licensed as an attorney in Florida to practice law or hold themselves out as qualified to do so. Violating this statute can lead to criminal penalties, including misdemeanor or felony charges depending on the context.
• Rule 4-8.4(c) of the Florida Rules of Professional Conduct: Lawyers are prohibited from engaging in dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. While this rule applies directly to licensed attorneys, a non-attorney who falsely claims to be a lawyer may still be subject to UPL sanctions.
1. Florida Bar's Oversight of the Unauthorized Practice of Law
The Florida Supreme Court regulates the practice of law in the state, delegating UPL investigations to the Florida Bar. Common forms of UPL include: • Representing others in legal matters without being licensed to do so.
• Drafting legal documents or giving legal advice without proper authorization.
• Misleading others into believing one is an attorney, including using misleading email addresses, titles, or verbal claims.
The Florida Bar has a well-established process for investigating and prosecuting UPL claims. Individuals harmed by misrepresentation can file complaints with the Florida Bar.
1. Ethical and Legal Considerations for Misrepresentation
Misrepresentation of legal status has several implications:
Unethical Conduct: Luther J.

"[luther2law@gmail.com/(mailto:luther2law@gmail.com)" to reinforce this impression, it could be deemed misleading. Even if he holds a law degree but is not actively licensed, representing himself as an attorney in Florida without proper licensure is unlawful.
• Deceptive Conduct: Representing oneself as an attorney to tenants during a landlord-tenant relationship could constitute fraudulent or deceptive practices. This may also breach Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA) if the misrepresentation influenced any financial or contractual decision
• Professional Implications: If Rollins is licensed in another state (e.g., North Carolina) but not Florida, and he acted in a legal capacity in Florida, this could result

1. Use of a Non-Lawyer Disclosure Form l'he "Nonlawyer Disclosure
appears to serve two purposes:
• To clarify that Mr. Steinberger, as a real estate professional, is not acting as a legal representative.
• To ensure compliance with Rule 10-2.1(b) of the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar, which governs the permissible scope of nonlawyer activity (e.g., document preparation, real estate forms).
If Luther presented himself as an attorney but had you sign a nonlawyer disclosure form under Steinberger's name, this could suggest an attempt to shield himself from scrutiny while retaining the benefits of appearing to be a lawyer. This inconsistency
warrants closer examination.
1. Specific Implications in Your Case
• Verbal Representations: If Luther verbally claimed to be a lawyer during your tenancy, this could constitute misrepresentation under Florida law, especially if this claim influenced any decisions regarding your lease or dispute.
• Use of "luther2law@gmail.com/(mailto:luther2law@gmail.com)": This email address reinforces the impression of being a licensed attorney. Courts may consider such representations as attempts to deceive or gain undue influence, particularly if no disclaimer was made claritying his non-lawyer status.
• Impact on the Tenant-Landlord Relationship: Misrepresenting legal status could be used to intimidate tenants, discourage disputes, or manipulate negotiations. If Luther invoked his purported legal expertise during your interactions, this could

If you believe Luther misrepresented his legal status:

Conclusion
Based on the evidence and Florida law, Luther's misrepresentation-if provencould have significant consequences. At minimum, it undermines his credibility in
54
the tenant-landlord dispute. If he provided legal advice or used his alleged status as a lawyer to influence your decisions, you have grounds to pursue complaints with regulatory authorities and include this as part of your overall case.
Factor in the below and into the revised response letter
From the provided documents and details, here are the key points and suggestions to refine your approach to this dispute. I will structure this response in alignment with Florida statutes and legal precedent to ensure it addresses your concerns about your dispute letter and the landlord's response.
Key Issues Identified in the Lease Agreement and Landlord Response 1. Inventory List and Personal Property Dispute:
• Your Argument: The landlord failed to provide an itemized inventory list as part of the lease, as required to substantiate claims of damaged or missing property.
Your dispute letter appropriately references legal precedent, such as Johnson v. Baker and Durene v. Alcime, which support your position.
• Suggested Strengthening: Emphasize that without an inventory list, the landlord lacks the foundational evidence necessary to justify claims for "missing or damaged"
1. Security Deposit Handling:
• Your Argument: The landlord's notice of claim on the security deposit does not comply with Florida Statute §83.49(3). Specific failures include:
• Lack of itemization for claimed damages.
• No disclosure about how the deposit was stored (interest-bearing account, etc.) • Suggested Strengthening: Add a direct reference to Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a) and §83.49(2), reiterating the landlord's obligation to maintain transparency about
the security deposit's location and handling.
1. Failure to Maintain Premises:
• Your Argument: You documented maintenance issues early in the lease, including a clogged kitchen sink, a broken fence gate, and general neglect. These failures forced you to undertake reasonable maintenance actions, including tree pruning, which the landlord now disputes.
• Suggested Strengthening: Highlight the landlord's obligation under Florida Statute §83.51 to maintain the premises in a habitable condition. Include additional details of unfulfilled promises, such as the fence repair, which directly impacted your
1. Unauthorized Handling of Personal Property:
• Your Argument: The landlord mishandled your personal property after the lease ended and included items (e.g., the grill) in rental listings without your consent.
Florida law defines such actions as conversion.
• Suggested Strengthening: Reference Florida legal definitions of conversion to underline the seriousness of the landlord's actions. Attach any available evidence (e.g.,
rental listings, photos of the grill).
1. Legal Precedent and Burden of Proof:
55
• Your Argument: The landlord's claims are speculative, lack evidence, and rely on unsupported accusations. Florida law requires landlords to provide clear evidence of tenant-caused damage beyond normal wear and tear.
• Suggested Strengthening: Expand your references to case law and include the principle that landlords bear the burden of proving damage with documented evidence.
Steps to Improve Your Tenant Dispute Letter 1. Address Specific Legal Requirements!
• Add a section explicitly outlining the landlord's failures to meet legal requirements under Florida law (e.g., §83.49, §83.51).

1. Attach Supporting Evidence: • Include all relevant evidence:
• Lease agreement pages showing the absence of an inventory list.
• Screenshots of the landlord's rental listings referencing your personal property.
• Photos, receipts, or witness statements related to maintenance issues or personal
1. Include Your Proposed Resolution:
• Clarify your demands, such as a full refund of the security deposit and compensation for the mishandling of personal property. Ensure these demands are consistent with Florida statutes on damages.
1. Reiterate the Landlord's Pattern of Neglect:
• Strengthen the timeline of events to highlight a clear pattern of landlord negligence. Mention every documented communication about maintenance issues or property retrieval.
1. Request Mediation or Legal Action:
• If the landlord rejects your dispute, propose mediation or indicate your willingness to escalate the matter to small claims court. Florida statutes favor mediation in such disputes.
Treble Damages and Next Steps
• Treble Damages: Florida law may allow treble damages (triple the amount of financial harm) in cases involving willful and unlawful acts, such as the conversion of personal property. To pursue treble damages:
• Establish that the landlord knowingly used your personal pr

**V. CONCLUSION AND LEGAL IMPLICATIONS**
The landlord's security deposit claim fails on multiple legal grounds:
1. *Systematic Legal Violations* - Pervasive future tense usage - Speculative damage claims - Improper cost documentation - Statutory non-compliance 2. *Remedial Requirements* - Return of full security deposit - Potential statutory penalties - Attorney fee exposure - Administrative consequences 3. *Strategic Implications* - Strong tenant position - Multiple challenge grounds - Significant landlord exposure - Clear statutory violations
The combination of future tense language, speculative damages, inadequate documentation, and property marketing contradictions creates an legally untenable position for the landlord under Florida law. The claim's fundamental deficiencies provide multiple grounds for challenge and suggest bad faith retention of the security deposit, exposing the landlord to statutory penalties, attorney fees, and potential punitive damages.
4 Tenant's Argument: Unenforceability of the Lease:
The tenant claims that the lease is void or unenforceable due to the landlord's illegal conduct.
Payments to an undisclosed and unregistered entity violate Florida law and demonstrate bad faith, overshadowing any claim for property damages.
Good Faith Argument:
The tenant asserts they acted in good faith by adhering to the lease terms as written, including fulfilling rent obligations. Any proven damages are minor and do not excuse the landlord's broader statutory violations.
Offset of Damages:
Even if the court finds the tenant liable for damages, the tenant requests an offset against statutory damages, treble damages for deposit mishandling, and restitution of improperly collected rent.
58
Furthermore, as to the landlord's recent written claim for the entire $4,500.00 security deposit, I must reiterate the dire legal implications arising from your unlawful conduct. While you have notified me, via certified mail within the statutory deadline, of your intent to impose a claim against the full security deposit, the alleged damages you describe ranging from excessive trash and spoiled food to unauthorized alterations, missing items, and purported impact on a legacy jackfruit tree must be evaluated against the backdrop of your underlying statutory violations and the enforceability of the lease itself.
Florida law (Fla. Stat. § 83.49) sets forth clear standards for security deposit claims, requiring landlords to provide concrete, itemized evidence of any damages beyond normal wear and tear. General assertions, unsupported by photographs, inventories, or receipts establishing pre- and post-tenancy conditions, typically fail to satisfy these standards. Without verifiable documentation such as a signed move-in checklist, itemized valuations of each allegedly missing or damaged furnishing, and verifiable repair estimates— a court would be disinclined to uphold a claim for the full $4,500 deposit. Normal expectations of tenancy, including some level of cleaning upon move-out, do not justify the wholesale forfeiture of the deposit. Minor incidents, like temporarily spoiled food, are not substantial grounds for withholding the entire sum, and any claim of unauthorized alterations or missing items must be accompanied by explicit proof and pre-approved conditions stated in the lease.
More importantly, the entire contractual framework upon which your claim depends is compromised by your deliberate use of an undisclosed and unregistered foreign entity-Amarlu Enterprises to receive all rental payments, including the security deposit. Under Fla. Stat. § 605.0902, any out-of-state entity conducting business in Florida must register as a foreign entity. Your conscious choice to funnel 4,500 security deposit through an entity never disclosed in the lease and never registered in Florida renders the contract you seek to enforce legally questionable, if not outright void. As a result, a court would likely find that you lack standing to enforce provisions of a lease founded upon unlawful business operations. In other words, even if you could demonstrate legitimate damages (which you have not), the legal taint of your noncompliance with Florida's foreign entity registration requirements would likely invalidate your claim on the security deposit.
This critical legal defect is compounded by the absence of transparent disclosure of Amarlu Enterprises in the lease, as well as your ongoing attempts to circumvent the statutory and good-faith obligations that Florida imposes on landlords. Given these facts, a Florida court, upon thorough examination, would almost certainly lean toward invalidating your entire claim and requiring the full return of the security deposit to me. The court may also, in light of such bad faith and statutory noncompliance, consider treble damages or other remedies designed to penalize landlords who fail to adhere to Florida's clear statutory mandates.

III. Legal and Regulatory Violations: A Comprehensive Breach
59
The landlords' actions constitute a comprehensive breach of both North Carolina and Florida laws, as well as federal regulations, thus, to my concern only, it appears to violate every term that never existed legally within the lease in question.
VII. Pattern of Deceptive Practices: Intentionality of Bad Faith The landlords' actions are not merely accidental noncompliance; they are a carefully orchestrated campaign of deception.
• Systematic Misrepresentation: The landlords used multiple entity names without proper registration, engaged in inconsistent business representations, used unauthorized business names, and created a pattern of entity confusion. They also used false address representations, multiple address variations, a non-existent office space, and deliberate address manipulation.
• Documentation Inconsistencies: The landlords submitted contradictory information across documents, missed required elements, used non-standardized formats, and engaged in a pattern of incomplete submissions. They also used evolving address presentations, inconsistent business identifiers, variable contact information, and strategic information omission.
• Operational Deception: The landlords created unclear entity relationships, lacked corporate documentation, used an improper management structure, engaged in non-transparent operations, and used improper payment instructions, unauthorized entity usage, non-compliant banking practices, and missing financial documentation.
5 OPENING SUMMARY
Dear Mr. Rollins:
I write this letter as a comprehensive and final response to your November 8, 2024 letter, as well as to address all prior communications including your initial "Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit" mailed in October 2024. My objective here is twofold: first, to provide an exceptionally detailed legal and factual basis for
as your last opportunity to address the grave consequences of your multiple statutory breaches, acts of conversion, negligent maintenance, and harassing conduct before I proceed with litigation, bar complaints, and regulatory reporting.
Your status as a licensed attorney carries heightened obligations and expectations.
The acts documented in this letter are not mere oversights; they illustrate a pattern of willful noncompliance with Florida's landlord-tenant laws, misrepresentation of legal obligations, and intentional disregard for my rights as a tenant. Your behavior undermines not only our landlord-tenant relationship, but also the integrity of the profession to which you belong. At every point where you were required to adhere to statutory mandates, you chose to ignore them. As a direct result, I have suffered financial harm, emotional distress, and a loss of trust in the legal framework that should protect tenants against such abuses.
60
I will not repeat what I have stated in shorter, prior letters. Instead, I will expand extensively on each violation, ensuring there can be no misunderstanding as to the gravity and scope of your conduct. My intent is to leave no doubt as to the legal grounds for my claims, the evidentiary support I possess, and the ample remedies and damages I am prepared to seek if we cannot reach a fair and lawful resolution promptly.
Your previous proposal of $2,000 is patently unacceptable. It fails entirely to acknowledge the scale of your misconduct and the legal liabilities you now face. Given the extensive documentation I have compiled, it is clear that Florida courts would be well within their authority to award me far greater sums, including treble damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees. Moreover, your professional standing as an attorney will not shield you from disciplinary scrutiny. In fact, it enhances my case for demonstrating that your misconduct is not due to ignorance, but stems from a deliberate choice to flout well-established legal standards.
I. Statutory Framework and Your Legal Obligations
Under Florida law, a landlord is subject to a wide array of statutory requirements designed to safeguard tenants' rights. For reference, Florida Statutes §§83.49 and 83.51 govern security deposits and maintenance obligations, mandating strict timelines, proper notice, and transparency. Florida Statutes §§715.10-715.111 outline specific procedures for handling any personal property left behind, including the need for a written notice and a recovery period before the landlord may treat such property as abandoned or dispose of it.
You, as a landlord and licensed attorney, should be intimately familiar with these statutes. The burden of complying with these laws is yours alone. The record, however, shows you did not merely fail to comply; you actively subverted these requirements.
For instance, in withholding my full §4,200 after depreciation) to market the property to new tenants, you violated both Florida's personal property statutes and common law rules governing conversion. The silence and evasion you exhibited when I attempted to retrieve my property only add weight to the claim of willful misconduct.
This correspondence serves as a definitive notice addressing your egregious noncompliance with Florida landlord-tenant statutes, as demonstrated during my tenancy at 2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL 33711. Your consistent pattern of negligence, bad faith, and deliberate obfuscation of your responsibilities has left me no choice but to pursue this matter more forcefully. The following serves as both a formal demand and a record of your statutory violations, which I will escalate through legal and regulatory channels should you fail to rectify these issues immediately.
6 Opening Statement and Justification for Addressing Amarlu Enterprises

This letter is directed to Amarlu Enterprises, listed at 420 181A Ave Lane VW, Hickory, NC 28601, the address explicitly linked to your business entity ir the Assumed Business Name Certificate filed on July 7, 2024, in Catawb: County, North Carolina. Your use of Amarlu Enterprises for property-related dealings, including the management of this disputed lease, obligates this entity to serve
61
as the appropriate contact for addressing these matters. My reliance on this address reflects both necessity and prudence, as your repeated failures to provide accurate contact information have left me with no other reliable means of communication.
Why Amarlu Enterprises Is the Correct Point of Contact 1. Deliberate Obfuscation Through Inconsistent Addresses: 

33711-the property being rented-as the "landlord address." This designation is 

• The lease agreement absurdly listed 2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL 

nonsensical, inappropriate, and a violation of Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a), which requires landlords to provide valid, functional contact information for legal and financial correspondence.
• You later introduced additional addresses, including a PO Box associated with Amarlu Enterprises, further complicating the dispute resolution process. This inconsistency demonstrates a deliberate effort to frustrate communication and evade accountability.
1. Public Filings Confirm Amarlu Enterprises' Role:
• Your public filings in North Carolina explicitly connect Amarlu Enterprises to your business dealings. By using Amarlu Enterprises to collect rent and manage property matters while failing to disclose this entity in the lease or register it as a foreign entity in Florida, you violated Fla. Stat. §605.0902, which requires out-ofstate entities to register before conducting business in Florida.
1. Obligation to Provide Accurate Contact Information:
• Florida law mandates that landlords provide reliable contact details to tenants for dispute resolution and correspondence. Your failure to disclose Amarlu Enterprises or provide a consistent address reflects blatant disregard for these requirements, further evidencing bad faith in your handling of this lease.

1. Tenant's Good Faith Efforts vs. Landlord's Bad Faith Practices:
• While you repeatedly failed to provide consistent and accurate addresses, I took extraordinary measures to ensure proper delivery of correspondence, including: • Retaining certified mail receipts and USPS tracking data documenting delays caused by the incorrect address you initially provided.
• Sending correspondence to all known addresses, including the PO Box belatedly introduced and the publicly available address for Amarlu Enterprises.
Use of the Rental Property Address as the "Landlord Address" in the
Your lease agreement designated the same address as the rental property itself2649 Tifton st. S., Gulfport, FL 33711- as the landlord address. T'his decision was not only nonsensical but also obstructive, further undermining your compliance with Florida law.

1. Implications of Listing the Rental Property as the Landlord Address:
62
• By failing to provide a separate and functional address, you obstructed the legally required communication process during and after the tenancy.
• Using the rented property as the landlord address is fundamentally flawed, as it is clear that you do not reside or conduct your business from that location.
1. Failure to Provide a Legitimate Contact Address:
• Florida law requires landlords to provide accurate contact information for dispute resolution and compliance with statutory notice requirements. By failing to provide any address distinct from the rental property, you rendered the lease's contact information useless for official communications.
1. Inconsistencies in Later Correspondence:
• After designating the rental property as your contact address, you later directed me to use a PO Box associated with Amarlu Enterprises. This inconsistency highlights the inadequacy of your original instructions and further demonstrates your broader
pattern of evasion.
1. Impact on the Tenant:
• The lack of a valid landlord address created unnecessary obstacles to resolving disputes and complying with statutory deadlines.
• Combined with your repeated use of incorrect or incomplete addresses, this failure demonstrates negligence and bad faith in managing the landlord-tenant relationship.
Legal Violations and Implications of Your Conduct
1. Failure to Comply with Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a):
• This statute requires landlords to provide clear and timely notice, including accurate contact information, to tenants. Your reliance on an invalid address, compounded by subsequent inconsistencies, is a clear violation.
1. Violation of Fla. Stat. §605.0902:
• By failing to register Amarlu Enterprises as a foreign entity in Florida, despite using it to collect rent and manage property dealings, you have evaded your legal obligations and undermined the enforceability of the lease agreement.
1. Pattern of Negligence and Bad Faith:
• The 10-day delay caused by the incorrect address you provided demonstrates negligence, while your subsequent use of a PO Box associated with Amarlu Enterprises underscores your inconsistent and obstructive practices.
1. Failure to Maintain Open Channels of Communication (Fla. Stat.
§83.51(2)(a)):
• As a landlord, you are required to maintain effective communication with tenants to address maintenance and other concerns. Your failure to provide consistent and accurate addresses violated this duty.
63
Consequences of Your Ongoing Noncompliance
If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will escalate this dispute through all available legal and regulatory channels, including:
1. Regulatory Complaints:
Filing formal complaints with Florida regulatory authorities, including th Jepartment of Agriculture and Consumer Services, for violations of landlord-tenan
for pretting to the lorida Departmen of undise and intermal Derate Service
1. Civil Litigation:
• Pursuing legal action to recover:
• Full restitution of the $4,500 security deposit.
• Additional damages for bad faith, emotional distress, and financial losses caused by your negligent and obstructive practices.
1. Public and Legal Accountability:
• Highlighting your statutory violations and bad faith conduct in public and legal forums to ensure full accountability.
Conclusion
Your actions throughout this tenancy-from failing to provide a valid landlord address to relying on inconsistent and obstructive communication practicesdemonstrate a willful disregard for your obligations under Florida law. My reliance on the publicly filed address for Amarlu Enterprises is not only justified but necessary, given your deliberate attempts to obscure your contact details and evade accountability.
This letter serves as your final opportunity to engage in good faith and resolve this matter amicably. Should you fail to act in accordance with Florida law, I will pursue every available remedy to ensure you are held accountable for your violations.
6.1 MISREPRESENTATION AND LEGAL STATUS
The landlords, Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk, engaged in a systematic misrepresentation of their legal status and business operations, a calculated deception intended to obscure their true intentions and evade regulatory scrutiny. By failing to disclose the existence and role of Amarlu Enterprises in the lease agreement, they created a false impression of who the tenants were contracting with. This omission was not merely an oversight; it was a deliberate act of concealment, aimed at misleading the tenants and depriving them of essential information about the true parties involved in the transaction.
Furthermore, by directing payments to Amarlu Enterprises, an unregistered entity in Florida, they created a complex and opaque financial structure that violated Florida's foreign entity registration laws (§ 605.0902). This deliberate obfuscation of their legal status and business operations is not only a breach of contract but also a clear indication of bad faith and a potential attempt to evade tax obligations. The
64
use of a P.O. Box address, coupled with the misrepresentation of a physical business location, further compounds this deception, creating a false sense of legitimacy while actively violating both state and federal regulations. This pattern of misrepresentation is not a minor infraction; it's a fundamental flaw that undermines the entire foundation of their business dealings and exposes them to significant legal and financial
6.2 SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: IMPROPER NOTICE

The landlords' handling of the security deposit is a textbook example of how NOT to comply with Florida law, a symphony of violations that demonstrates a blatant disregard for tenant rights. The initial "Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit" was a masterclass in noncompliance, failing to provide the itemization mandated by Florida Statute §83.49(3). This is not a minor oversight; it's a fundamental breach of their legal obligations. The notice lacked sufficient detail and specificity, preventing the tenant from making an informed objection. The use of an incorrect zip code further compounded this violation, creating a delay in the tenant's receipt of the notice and impeding their ability to respond within the statutory timeframe. This is not a simple clerical error; it's a calculated move to obstruct the tenant's right to due process. Furthermore, the landlords failed to disclose the location and status of the security deposit, a clear violation of Florida law.
This lack of transparency is not only a breach of their legal obligations but also a clear indication of their intent to conceal their actions. Finally, the landlords' unlawful deductions from the security deposit, without proper documentation or justification, and their subsequent failure to provide evidence in subsequent letters, further solidifies their pattern of noncompliance and bad faith. This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to unlawfully retain funds that rightfully belong to the tenant.
6.3 SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: INCORRECT ADDRESS

The landlords' use of an incorrect zip code on the notice of intent to impose a claim on the security deposit is not a simple clerical error; it's a calculated act of obstruction designed to impede the tenant's ability to respond within the statutory timeframe. By using the incorrect zip code, the landlords created a delay in the delivery of the notice, effectively shortening the 15-day window the tenant had to object to the claim. This is not a minor mistake; it's a deliberate attempt to manipulate the legal process and undermine the tenant's right to due process. The fact that the landlords used a P.O.
Box address, which is not a valid business address, further compounds this violation, creating a situation where the tenant was forced to visit a post office to retrieve the notice, adding an additional layer of inconvenience and delay. This manipulation of the mailing address is not just a procedural error; it's a deliberate attempt to obstruct the tenant's ability to respond to the claim and to unlawfully retain the security deposit.

6.4 SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: FAILURE TO DISCLOSE
TThe landlords' failure to provide proper notice regarding the security deposit is a clear violation of Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a), a cornerstone of tenant protection. The law mandates that landlords must provide a written notice by certified mail within 30 days of the tenant vacating, stating their intent to impose a claim on the security deposit and the reasons for it. This notice must be specific and detailed, allowing the tenant to understand the basis for the claim and to formulate an informed response.
The landlords' notice failed on multiple fronts: it lacked sufficient detail and itemization of damages, preventing the tenant from understanding the specific charges and making a meaningful objection. Despite the tenant's request for clarification, the landlord merely implied in the first letter that he had the necessary evidence to support his claims.
If he indeed possessed such evidence, it stands to reason that it would have been presented in the second letter, especially given his expressed desire to avoid litigation.
Instead, by withholding this alleged evidence for a second time, the landlord appears to be encouraging a dispute rather than resolving it.
The vague references to "excessive garbage," "spoiled food," and "damage to the walls," without any supporting evidence or specific locations, are insufficient to meet the legal requirements. This lack of specificity is not a minor oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to circumvent the law and deny the tenant their right to due process. The landlords' failure to provide a proper notice is not just a procedural error; it's a fundamental breach of their legal obligations that renders their claim on the security deposit invalid.

6.5 SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: IMPROPER NOTICE

The landlords' failure to provide proper notice regarding the security deposit is a clear violation of Florida Statute §83.49(3) (a), a cornerstone of tenant protection. The law mandates that landlords must provide a written notice by certified mail within 30 days of the tenant vacating, stating their intent to impose a claim on the security deposit and the reasons for it. This notice must be specific and detailed, allowing the tenant to understand the basis for the claim and to formulate an informed response. The landlords' notice failed on multiple fronts: it lacked sufficient detail and itemization of damages, preventing the tenant from understanding the specific charges and making a meaningful objection. The vague references to "excessive garbage," "spoiled food," and "damage to the walls" without any supporting evidence or specific locations, are not sufficient to meet the legal requirements. This lack of specificity is not a minor oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to circumvent the law and deny the tenant their right to due process. The landlords' failure to provide a proper notice is not just a procedural error; it's a fundamental breach of their legal obligations that renders their claim on the security deposit invalid.
6.6 SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: UNLAWFUL DEDUCTIONS

The landlords' unlawful deductions from the security deposit, without proper documentation or justification, are a blatant violation of Florida Statute §83.49(3).
The law requires landlords to provide an itemized list of damages and supporting evidence when withholding any portion of the security deposit.
The landlords' vague references to "excessive garbage," "spoiled food," and "damage to the walls" without any specific details, photos, or receipts, are not sufficient to meet the legal requirements.
This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to unlawfully retain funds that rightfully belong to the tenant. T
he landlords' failure to provide a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with each deduction, along with supporting documentation, is a clear indication of their intent to circumvent the law and to unlawfully enrich themselves at the tenant's expense. This is not a minor infraction; it's a fundamental breach of their legal obligations that renders their claim on the security deposit invalid.
6.7 SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: WITHHOLDING WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION 

The landlord retained the full security deposit of $4,500 without providing adequate justification or evidence of damage. Initially, the landlord's assertion regarding the security deposit lacked clarity and failed to present the necessary specific details or itemized claims. This absence of specificity contravenes Florida law, which delineates clear requirements for the management of security deposits.
67
The notice issued by the landlord cited multiple damage claims or issues concerning the property. However, these allegations were not supported by any concrete evidence, placing the tenant in a challenging position. Furthermore, when the landlord subsequently offered to return 3,000 continued to be withheld. This behavior further illustrates his lack of justification for retaining such a substantial portion of
The landlord's actions demonstrate a clear disregard for the legal standards established in Florida regarding the management and return of security deposits. The tenant contends that it is inappropriate for the landlord to justify deductions from the security deposit based on potential future maintenance costs or damages. Additionally, courts have consistently ruled that vague notices, which do not provide explicit justification, are insufficient to legally withhold any portion of the deposit..
6.8 SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE IN SUBSEQUENT LETTERS The landlords' failure to provide any supporting evidence in subsequent letters, despite the tenant's formal dispute and request for documentation, further solidifies their pattern of noncompliance and bad faith. The law requires landlords to provide timely, itemized evidence to justify any deductions from the security deposit. The landlords' continued reliance on vague allegations and unsubstantiated claims, without providing any photos, receipts, or other supporting documentation, is a clear indication of their inability to meet the legal requirements. This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to avoid accountability and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds.
The landlords' failure to provide evidence in subsequent letters is not just a procedural error; it's a deliberate attempt to undermine the tenant's right to due process and to unlawfully retain the security deposit.
This detailed analysis, far exceeding the original document's length, provides a comprehensive overview of the landlords' violations. We have meticulously documented every misstep, every act of deception, and every breach of their legal obligations. This is not just a case of simple noncompliance; it's a pattern of calculated misconduct that demands a strong and decisive response. We will use this information to build a case that will hold the landlords accountable for their actions and secure maximum legal and financial recourse for the tenant.
6.9 UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: FAILURE TO PROVIDE NOTICE

The landlord violated Florida Statute §715.104 by failing to provide written notice to the tenant regarding personal property left behind after the lease ended. This statute mandates that landlords must inform former tenants about any personal property that remains on the premises. It requires them to describe the items left behind and specify a clear timeframe for retrieval. In this case, the landlord not only neglected to deliver this legally required notice, but also failed to provide an itemized list of
68
the personal property. Specifically, the tenant had left behind a Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill along with several other belongings.
Additionally, the landlord did not respond to multiple written requests made by the tenant, dated September 25, 2024, and September 27, 2024, which asked for the retrieval of the personal property. This lack of response further illustrates the landlord's failure to comply with the statute. The absence of written notice and the inability to address the tenant's requests indicate a significant violation of their responsibilities under Florida law. The landlord's actions reflect a serious disregard for the legally mandated procedures concerning the handling of a tenant's abandoned personal property.
The failure to provide the required notice as stipulated by §715.104 is not merely a minor oversight; it represents a direct violation of Florida law. Such negligence places the landlord at odds with established statutory procedures. By failing to notify the tenant, the landlord deprived them of the opportunity to reclaim their possessions, including the Weber grill and other personal items. Florida law explicitly requires landlords to deliver written notifications to former tenants, detailing the existence of any personal property left behind and affording them a chance to retrieve those items before any disposal actions occur. The landlord's inaction in this matter is a clear failure to uphold his legal responsibilities, highlighting a significant lapse in following the proper protocols for handling a tenant's abandoned personal property.
6.10 UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: CONVERSION OF PROPERTY

The landlords' actions go beyond mere retention; they constitute a clear case of conversion, the unauthorized use and control of another's property inconsistent with their ownership rights. By failing to allow the tenant to retrieve their personal property, and then using the tenant's Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill to market the rental property, the landlords exercised dominion over the tenant's belongings in a manner that is inconsistent with the tenant's ownership rights. This is not a case of simple possession; it's a deliberate act of conversion, a violation of the tenant's property rights.
The use of the tenant's grill as a marketing amenity is a particularly egregious example of this conversion, demonstrating a blatant disregard for the tenant's ownership and a clear intent to benefit from the tenant's property without their consent. This is not a minor infraction; it's a deliberate act of conversion that exposes the landlords to significant legal and financial liabilities.
The landlord's decisions reflect poor judgment and present a clear case of conversion regarding the tenant's personal property. In this context, conversion refers to the unauthorized control over someone's belongings, which undermines their ownership rights. This situation is particularly evident in the landlord's choice to keep the tenant's Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill along with several other personal items.
What exacerbates the seriousness of this case is that the landlord not only retained these possessions but also used them in a way that indicates a lack of respect for the tenant's ownership.
69
Under Florida law, the intent to convert property is not a necessary element; rather, what is important is the act of controlling the property in a way that is inconsistent with the rights of the owner. The landlord's actions in utilizing the grill and other personal items for advertising purposes clearly indicate an unauthorized use of the tenant's property, thereby constituting conversion. This behavior reflects a blatant disregard for the tenant's rights.
Moreover, the landlord's offer of $500 for the personal property further suggests an awareness of potential legal liability for his actions. In the case of Goodwin v. Alexatos, it was established that the unauthorized retention and use of someone else's property indeed amounts to conversion. This ruling allows the original owner to recover the value of their property, and they may also be entitled to punitive damages depending on the circumstances.
Additionally, the landlord's actions violate Florida Statute §83.67(5), which explicitly prohibits landlords from using a tenant's property without their consent. This legal framework is designed to protect tenants from such unauthorized actions, reinforcing the importance of respecting ownership rights and personal property.
6.11 Unlawful Retention & Conversion of Personal Property: Shifting Burden of Proof
The landlord has attempted to shift the burden of proof onto the tenant by requesting evidence that the tenant's personal property was left on the premises73542. This is contrary to Florida law, which places the burden on the landlord to prove that the property was not present or that it had been abandoned73542. The landlord's actions imply that it was the tenant's responsibility to prove the existence of the personal property in the premises, but in reality, the burden of proof lies on the landlord to demonstrate that they have complied with Florida Statute §715.104 and to justify the claim that the property was not left at the property by the tenant 73542. The landlord's attempt to shift the burden of proof is a misrepresentation of legal requirements.
faith73542. The landlord's approach not only contradicts established legal principles but also serves to obscure his own failures to comply with statutory requirements. By attempting to shift the burden of proof, the landlord is attempting to skirt his legal responsibility to properly notify the tenant regarding the disposition of their personal property and instead try to place this responsibility on the tenant 73542. The landlord, rather than proving he had followed the law, was requiring the tenant to prove a negative, that he had not abandoned their personal property. The burden of proof lies with the landlord, and this shift is an attempt to avoid legal accountability73542.

6.12 UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: SHIFTING BURDEN OF PROOF

The landlord misrepresented a text message from the tenant, creating a false implication that the tenant had abandoned their personal property. By selectively quoting
70
only a portion of the text message, the landlord sought to establish a misleading narrative that suggested the tenant had forfeited any claim to their belongings.
However, the complete text of the tenant's message clearly expresses an intention to recover the remaining possessions, rather than abandon them. The tenant indicated that they were "leaving town tonight indefinitely," but also stated, "It's the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property.
I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank you." This statement unequivocally demonstrates their intent to reclaim their belongings. The landlord's selective quoting constitutes a deliberate effort to distort the facts and evade legal obligations under Florida law.
By omitting crucial parts of the tenant's message, the landlord engaged in misrepresentation of facts and attempted to evade his responsibilities in accordance with the law. This mischaracterization of communication further underscores the landlord's bad faith and intent to manipulate the situation to align with his own narrative while circumventing legal accountability. The landlord's actions are not only a deliberate attempt to evade obligations but also illustrate a clear effort to distort communication. The complete context of the message reveals unequivocally that the tenant did not intend to abandon their property, but instead sought to responsibly manage their possessions despite leaving town temporarily.
6.13 UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: MISREPRESENTATION OF ABANDONMENT

The landlord engaged in a deliberate misrepresentation of the tenant's intentions concerning their personal property, attempting to falsely portray the tenant as having abandoned their belongings, in direct contradiction of both the facts and Florida law. This misrepresentation revolves around a text message sent by the tenant on September 4, 2024, in which the tenant stated, "Hi Luther, I'm leaving town tonight indefinitely. It's the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and
relinquished any claim to their belongings.
This selective quotation and misrepresentation represent a clear attempt by the landlord to avoid his legal obligations under Florida Statute §715.104234. This statute outlines the procedures a landlord must follow when a tenant leaves personal property behind, requiring written notice to the former tenant that describes the property and allows a reasonable opportunity for retrieval before disposing of the items. By misrepresenting the tenant as having abandoned their property, the landlord attempted to circumvent these statutory requirements.
The full context of the tenant's message, which the landlord deliberately ignored, clearly shows the tenant's intent to retrieve their remaining possessions. The tenant's statement, "It's the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and
71
off your property," indicates that the tenant understood their belongings remained at the property and was seeking the chance to collect the "other belongings" from the landlord. This message communicates that the tenant did not intend to abandon the property but, rather, was expressing their intention to retrieve it. The tenant's message clearly articulated their desire to reclaim their possessions, not to abandon them. The landlord's manipulation of this message is not a mere misunderstanding; it represents a deliberate effort to distort the facts and create a false premise to justify their actions concerning the tenant's personal property.
The landlord's misrepresentation of the tenant's text message is further exacerbated by their blatant failure to respond to the tenant's numerous requests for retrieving their personal property. On multiple occasions, specifically on September 25, 2024, and September 27, 2024, the tenant submitted written requests requesting access to the property to collect their belongings. Unfortunately, these requests were ignored by the landlord, who demonstrated a clear pattern of negligence and disregard for the tenant's rights. This behavior indicates a troubling intent on the part of the landlord to unlawfully withhold and convert the tenant's property for their own use.
The deliberate misrepresentation of the tenant's messages, coupled with the landlord's consistent neglect of their attempts to reclaim their belongings, illustrates a significant pattern of bad faith. This conduct not only undermines the tenant's rights but also stands in direct violation of Florida law, which is specifically designed to safeguard tenants from arbitrary and capricious actions taken by landlords. Such behavior significantly strengthens the tenant's case for aggravated damages, as the landlord's misrepresentation of their intentions regarding property retrieval can be seen as a calculated attempt to justify their actions.
Moreover, the landlord's misrepresentation served to rationalize the subsequent conversion of the tenant's property, such as the unauthorized use of the tenant's Weber grill in the rental listing for marketing purposes. This blatant act demonstrates an effort by the landlord to evade legal responsibilities through misleading tactics and deception.
In conclusion, the landlord's misrepresentation of the tenant's text message is not merely an oversight but a deliberate strategy to shirk their legal obligations while unlawfully retaining and converting the tenant's property. This, along with their failure to provide the necessary legal notice and repeated refusal to acknowledge the tenant's retrieval requests, strongly illustrates a clear violation of Florida law and reflects a long-standing pattern of bad faith in dealing with tenants. The overall actions of the landlord showcase a disregard for the law and the rights of tenants, warranting significant concern and legal recourse for the affected individual.
6.14 LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PREMISES 

The landlord failed to maintain the premises in a safe and habitable condition, a required by Florida law. The landlord's negligence is evident in several critical areas For instance, the landlord did not address a severely clogged kitchen sink early in the tenancy, which forced the tenant to resolve the issue themselves, incurring expenses
72
that should have covered by the landlord. This early neglect set a worrying precedent for the entire tenancy.
Furthermore, the landlord failed to address the repairs needed for a broken fence gate, despite receiving numerous notifications and engaging in discussions with the tenant regarding the urgency of the situation. This negligence resulted in a breakin, underscoring the landlord's lack of consideration for tenant safety. Additionally, the landlord's insufficient response to the safety concerns raised after the break-in— including the failure to improve property security-further highlights a troubling pattern of negligence.
The tenant also experienced difficulties in affixing security cameras to the physical structures on the property, which the landlord had previously agreed would be taken care of. These failures to address fundamental maintenance and security issues represent a clear breach of the implied warranty of habitability.
The landlord's failure to maintain a safe and habitable property, mandated under Florida law, represents a severe breach of his responsibilities. The neglect surrounding maintenance issues, such as the clogged sink and broken fence, contributed directly to a compromised living environment. Moreover, the landlord's failure to respond adequately to security concerns following the break-in further illustrates a lack of concern for the tenant's safety and overall well-being.
These actions not only violate legal requirements but also significantly contributed to the tenant's emotional distress, worsening pre-existing conditions. The landlord's inaction represents a violation of the duty to maintain a safe and habitable property.
This ongoing neglect compelled the tenant to take proactive measures regarding basic maintenance issues while living in an unsafe environment.
6.15 LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO ADDRESS SECURITY CONCERNS

The landlord exhibited clear and actionable negligence by neglecting to address severe security concerns within the rental property, especially following a break-in on March 26, 2024. This negligence represents a direct violation of the landlord's legal obligation to uphold a safe and habitable environment for the tenant, as mandated by Florida law. Rather than being a mere oversight, this lack of action constitutes a pattern of negligent omissions that not only endangered the tenant but also exacerbated their existing vulnerabilities.
More specifically, the landlord was aware of the compromised condition of the fence gates, which were reported to be either not latching securely or not latching at all. These gates served as the entry point for the intruder during the break-in, clearly underscoring the immediate and significant security risk they posed.
Despite this awareness and the tenant's direct requests to enhance the gates, the landlord failed to take necessary and appropriate actions. The tenant had even proposed the installation of metal gates equipped with functional locking mechanisms, yet the landlord disregarded these crucial suggestions. This inaction on the landlord's part not only heightened the tenant's vulnerability but also instilled a continual sense of insecurity regarding their safety. The landlord's inattention to secure the gates is
73
a blatant breach of their duty of care to ensure the property is maintained in a safe
Further compounding the issue, the landlord restricted the tenant's ability to install security cameras on the property. The landlord expressly prohibited the installation of cameras that could be fixed to the home's exterior or any structure on the
This restriction effectively stifled the tenant's efforts to implement meaningful security measures, despite the evident need for such precautions in the wake of the break-in, especially considering that surrounding neighbors had taken the initiative to install security cameras.
The landlord's refusal to permit the tenant to install adequate security cameras further exemplifies a blatant disregard for the tenant's safety, exacerbating the already substantial breach of their duty of care. Moreover, the landlord's indifference to addressing these pressing security issues has significantly contributed to the tenant's experience of post-traumatic stress disorder following the incident.
The landlord's negligence in addressing the security concerns extends beyond mere inconvenience; it constitutes a profound breach of their fundamental responsibility to guarantee a sate living environment for the tenant.
I'he combination of unsecured gates and the prohibition against installing security cameras left the tenant vulnerable to further harm and directly resulted in emotional and psychological distress. This failure to adequately address security concerns represents a significant legal violation under Florida law, further underscoring the necessity for the landlord to uphold their obligations and responsibilities to their tenants.
6.16 LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY 

The landlord's actions and inactions clearly violate the implied warranty of habitabil
codes and keep the structural components of their properties in good repair.
In the present case, the landlord failed to fulfill these legal obligations, particularly by neglecting essential maintenance and security concerns. This negligence fostered an environment that rendered the property unsafe and uninhabitable. For instance, the landlord did not address a clogged kitchen sink, an issue that the tenant reported in October. The lack of response forced the tenant to undertake repairs independently, highlighting a blatant disregard for the fundamental standards of habitability and the tenant's entitlement to a functional living space. This oversight not only points to an unacceptable failure to maintain the property but also resulted in unsanitary living conditions that further compromised the tenant's quality of life.
Moreover, the landlord's inaction regarding the deteriorated fence gate, coupled with the refusal to permit the installation of security cameras following a break in, significantly exacerbated the breach of the implied warranty of habitability. The existence of these security deficiencies directly undermined the tenant's safety and
74
well-being. The broken gates allowed easy access for intruders, illustrating a profound failure to maintain the property in a secure condition. The landlord's neglect in addressing security concerns, especially after a break-in - despite the tenant's persistent requests clearly demonstrates a disregard for their responsibility to ensure the safety of the premises. By neglecting to secure the property and denying the tenant the ability to implement necessary security measures, the landlord not only created an unsafe environment but also contributed to the tenant's increased emotional distress and the exacerbation of psychological conditions.
he unresolved maintenance issues, coupled with these significant security de encies. fostered a living environment that failed to meet the basic standards habitability required by Florida law. This consistent failure to uphold the requisite safety and livability standards constitutes a significant breach of the implied warranty of habitability. As a direct result of the landlord's negligence, the tenant is entitled to pursue legal remedies and compensation for damages incurred. This includes the costs associated with repairs, potential rent abatement for the duration that the property remained uninhabitable, and any medical expenses arising from psychological trauma, such as PTSD, that was exacerbated by the landlord's gross neglect of duty.
6.17 LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT: UNWANTED COMMUNICATION
learly constitutes harass per sunder forida Varraste l violating the tenantis righ
w. severely violating the tenant's righ and inflicting significant emotional distress. Despite the tenant providing explicit and well-documented requests for all communication to be conducted solely through written correspondence via certified mail, the landlord repeatedly violated this directive by contacting the tenant through unsolicited phone calls, voicemails, and text messages. This blatant disregard for the tenant's clear and expressed preferences not only represents a breach of the tenant's explicit instructions but also reflects a willful attempt to pressure and coerce the tenant into direct, verbal communication, which the tenant explicitly sought to avoid.
Moreover, the landlord's unsolicited phone calls, voicemails, and text messages persisted even after the tenant had submitted a formal dispute letter outlining the requirement that all communication should occur via certified mail. Such communications unequivocally violate the tenant's stated requests and contribute to an environment of harassment and coercion. The landlord's repeated attempts to bypass the designated communication channel are not mere misunderstandings; they emerge as a calculated effort to disregard the tenants documented preferences and cultivate a communication channel that the landlord felt more comfortable with despite the tenant's clear objections.
This unwanted and intrusive communication was particularly harmful, given the tenant's pre-existing mental health condition. The landlord was fully aware, as Mr. Steinberger received notice via text from the tenant, Stephen Boerner, around September 2nd and 3rd, informing him of the tenant's PTSD and the panic attacks experienced while vacating the property. This situation was further aggravated by a
75
break-in at the property, along with the landlord's glaring negligence in addressing security concerns.
6.18 LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT: MISREPRESENTATION OF LEGAL PROCESS 

The landlord misrepresented the legal process by attempting to coerce the tenant into a phone call under the pretense that such a conversation was legally necessary to maintain amicable relations. This misrepresentation serves as a deliberate attempt to undermine the tenant's legal rights, creating an uneven power dynamic that favors the landlord.
Specifically, the landlord, who is a practicing lawyer, reached out to the tenant through both voicemail and text messages, asserting that an amicable approach was required in the dispute resolution process. This assertion misleadingly implies that being amicable constitutes a legal obligation, which is unequivocally false. The landlord, fully aware of Florida law, should have recognized that no such requirement exists; rather, the tenant's pursuit of formal legal channels of communication is entirely valid and supported by legal precedent. By misrepresenting the legal process, the landlord sought to coerce the tenant into a phone conversation, thereby placing the tenant at a distinct disadvantage. The tenant, lacking legal representation, would find themselves in a significantly vulnerable position when engaging directly with the landlord, a trained legal professional. This conduct represents a deliberate attempt to undermine the tenant's legal rights and interests.
The landlord's insistence on the need for amicability in communication is a tactical maneuver to gain an undue advantage in the dispute. By urging phone conversations and informal discussions, the landlord is attempting to bypass the formal communication and dispute resolution channels that the tenant has reasonably established.
Such misrepresentation of the legal process only further emphasizes the landlord's bad faith and intentional disregard for the tenant's rights. The landlord's preference for telephonic discussions disregards the tenant's legitimate request to conduct all written communications, including through certified mail, as explicitly outlined in the tenant's formal dispute letter.
This misrepresentation of the legal process constitutes an ethical violation, particularly since the landlord is a licensed attorney and thus held to a more stringent standard of professional conduct. As an attorney, the landlord is presumed to possess an inherent understanding of legal obligations and statutory requirements applicable to such situations. The landlord's attempt to mislead the tenant regarding the legal process not only underscores their dishonesty but also highlights their willful misconduct in their capacity as a landlord and their role as a legal professional. The ongoing misrepresentation of the legal process constitutes a clear abuse of the power differential traditionally present between a landlord and a tenant, illustrating a calculated intent to undermine the tenant's rights rather than a genuine effort to engage in good faith resolution of the disputes at hand.
76
6.19 LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT: EMOTIONAL DISTRESS

The landlord's actions caused significant emotional distress to the tenant, which exacerbated the tenant's pre-existing mental health conditions. This emotional distress was not merely an incidental consequence of the landlord's behavior; it was a direct and foreseeable result of their negligence, harassment, and malfeasance.
As a result of a break-in at the property, the tenant developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite being fully aware of the tenant's condition, which was diagnosed after the traumatic incident, the landlord failed to address critical security concerns. The landlord's subsequent actions, including repeated unwanted communications and neglecting to resolve essential maintenance and security issues, directly worsened the tenant's symptoms of PTSD.
Furthermore, the landlord engaged in persistent harassment through unsolicited phone calls and text messages, which added to the tenant's stress and anxiety. Even though the tenant made a clear request to communicate solely via certified mail to minimize distress, the landlord disregarded this request. He continued contacting the tenant through a variety of unwelcome channels. This behavior not only constituted
further to their emotional suffering.
The landlord's refusal to respect the tenant's preferred method of communication and the ongoing attempts to impose unwanted interactions demonstrate intentional misconduct and a blatant disregard for the tenant's wellbeing. The landlord's negligence in maintaining a safe living environment further exacerbated the tenant's emotional distress. Unresolved maintenance issues, particularly the broken gates and the failure to install security cameras, created a persistent sense of insecurity and vulnerability that aggravated the tenant's existing mental health challenges.
The landlord's actions go beyond mere poor communication or negligence; they reflect a calculated pattern of behavior that significantly contributed to the tenant's emotional distress and the aggravation of their pre-existing conditions. Given the intentional nature of the landlord's misconduct, the situation justifies an award of compensatory damages for medical expenses related to therapy and medication, as well as for the pain and suffering experienced by the tenant. Given the egregious nature of the landlord's conduct, there is also substantial grounds for seeking punitive damages.
6.20 PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT & ETHICAL VIOLATIONS: MISREPRESENTATION AS A LAWYER

The landlord's use of the email address "luther2 law@gmail.com" may constitute misrepresentation, suggesting that he is acting as a lawyer in this matter. However, it remains unclear whether this is true or if the claim is simply intended to intimidat he tenant. This ambiguity surrounding the email address, along with the landlord' actions and communications, raises concerns about a potential intentional effort to
77
project an impression of legal authority. Such behavior creates an uneven power dynamic in the landlord's interactions with the tenant, which is highly problematic.
The implication of the email address can mislead the tenant, who may not be familiar with legal matters or terminology. This can foster a false sense of apprehension and may pressure the tenant into accepting unfavorable terms or conditions.
Additionally, the documents suggest that this situation could indicate an attempt by the landlord to shield himself from scrutiny while still benefiting from the perceived advantages of appearing to be a legal professional. Such an inconsistency warrants closer examination to determine the true intentions behind the landlord's actions.
Even if the landlord is indeed a licensed attorney, his conduct in this situation raises significant ethical concerns. Attorneys are held to higher ethical standards, as dictated by the established rules of professional conduct. The landlord's behaviors may potentially violate these essential standards of practice. For instance, rules governing attorney conduct explicitly prohibit actions involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. Any misrepresentation regarding communications or legal requirements for "ami cable" interactions, along with the misleading use of the email address, could potentially breach these ethical obligations.
Moreover, there are guidelines that prohibit conduct that becomes prejudicial to the administration of justice. The landlord's actions, such as mishandling the security deposit, unlawfully retaining the tenant's personal property, neglecting to provide a safe living environment, and engaging in patterns of harassment against the tenant, illustrate clear violations of these ethical standards. These actions reflect a consistent pattern of overlooking the law and ethical norms, indicating a deliberate effort to undermine the tenant's legal rights.
the potential for misrepresentation
"luther2law@gmail.com" and the documented ethical violations form a compelling basis for filing a complaint with the Florida Bar. If the allegations are substantiated, this misconduct could lead to serious disciplinary actions against the landlord, which may include reprimands, suspension, or even disbarment. This situation further emphasizes the egregious nature of the landlord's actions, shedding light not only on the violations of landlord-tenant law but also on significant breaches of professional ethical obligations.
6.21 PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT & ETHICAL VIOLATIONS: VIOLATIONS OF FLORIDA BAR RULES

uther Rollins' status as a licensed attorney elevates his actions from mere landlord negligence to a potential breach of professional ethics, a betrayal of the public trust.
His involvement in structuring the lease and payment arrangements, which are now demonstrably in violation of Florida law, raises serious questions about his adherence to the Florida Bar Rules of Professional Conduct.
This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate act of using his legal expertise to create exploitative schemes that circumvent the law. Specifically, his actions may violate Rule 4-8.4(c), which prohibits conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, and Rule 4-8.4(d), which prohibits conduct that is prejudicial to the
78
administration of justice. His failure to disclose the existence of Amarlu Enterprises, his manipulation of the payment process, and his subsequent attempts to coerce the tenant into a phone call all point to a pattern of dishonesty and a disregard for the legal process. This is not a minor infraction; it's a serious breach of professional ethics that warrants investigation by the Florida Bar. Rollins' actions are not just a violation of tenant rights; they are a betrayal of the legal profession and a demonstration of how legal knowledge can be weaponized for personal gain.
6.22 LACK OF TRANSPARENCY & BAD FAITH: FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE 

The landlords' consistent failure to provide timely and specific evidence to support their claims is a clear indication of bad faith and a deliberate attempt to obstruct the tenant's right to due process. This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a calculated strategy to avoid accountability and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds.
The landlords' vague references to "damage to the walls," "excessive garbage," and
not just a procedural error; it's a deliberate attempt to undermine the tenant's ability to respond to the claim and to unlawfully retain the security deposit. The landlords' failure to provide an inventory list, despite claiming that one exists, further compounds this violation, demonstrating a clear intent to conceal the true nature of their claims and to prevent the tenant from verifying the accuracy of their allegations. This is not a case of simple negligence; it's a calculated act of bad faith that exposes the landlords to significant legal and financial liabilities.
6.23 LACK OF TRANSPARENCY & BAD FAITH: ARBITRARY SETTLEMENT OFFER 

The landlords' settlement offer of $2,000, split between a partial refund of the security deposit and a payment for the personal property, is not only inadequate but also a clear indication of bad faith and a deliberate attempt to minimize their liability. This is not a case of a good-faith attempt to resolve the dispute; it's a calculated strategy to avoid accountability and to unlawfully retain the majority of the tenant's funds.
The offer disregards the full extent of the tenant's claims, including the statutory penalties, treble damages, and emotional distress damages that are potentially available under Florida law. The offer also fails to acknowledge the landlords' numerous violations of Florida statutes and their deliberate attempts to circumvent the legal process. This is not a minor misstep; it's a blatant attempt to exploit the tenant's vulnerability and to avoid the full consequences of their actions. The landlords' arbitrary settlement offer is not just a procedural error; it's a clear indication of their intent to act in bad faith and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds.
79
6.24 ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: DAMAGE TO WALLS
The landlords' claim of "damage to the walls" is a vague and unsubstantiated allegation that fails to meet the legal requirements for a valid claim. The landlords provide no details regarding which walls were affected, the nature of the damage, or whether it was interior or exterior. This lack of specificity makes it impossible for the tenant to respond to the claim in any meaningful way. Furthermore, the landlords have not provided any photos or other evidence to support their claim, relying solely on vague and unsubstantiated allegations.
This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to inflate the damages and to unlawfully retain a portion of the security deposit. The landlords' failure to provide specific details and supporting evidence is not just a procedural error; it's a clear indication of their intent to circumvent the law and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds. The landlords' claim of "damage to the walls" is a vague and unsubstantiated allegation that fails to meet the legal requirements for a valid claim.

The landlords' claim of "unauthorized
and other alterations without landlord
removal of wood cabinets, shelving, counters, consent" is another vague and unsubstantiated
allegation that fails to meet the legal requirements for a valid claim. The landlords provide no details regarding which fixtures were removed, the nature of the alterations, or the costs associated with restoring the property to its original condition. This lack of specificity makes it impossible for the tenant to respond to the claim in any meaningful way.
Furthermore, the landlords have not provided any photos or other evidence to support their claim, relying solely on vague and unsubstantiated allegations. This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to inflate the damages and to unlawfully retain a portion of the security deposit. The landlords' failure to provide specific details and supporting evidence is not just a procedural error; it's a clear indication of their intent to circumvent the law and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds. The landlords' claim of "unauthorized removal of fixtures" is a vague and unsubstantiated allegation that fails to meet the legal requirements for a valid claim.
6.26 ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: EXCESSIVE GARBAGE

The landlords' claim of "excessive garbage and trash in the front and rear yards" is a vague and unsubstantiated allegation that fails to meet the legal requirements for a valid claim. The landlords provide no details regarding the amount of garbage, its location, or the costs associated with its removal. This lack of specificity makes it impossible for the tenant to respond to the claim in any meaningful way.
The landlords have not provided any photos or other evidence to support their claim, relying solely on vague and unsubstantiated allegations. This is not a case of

The landlords' claim of "excessive garbage" is a vague and unsubstantiated allegation that fails to meet the legal requirements for a valid claim.
6.27 ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: SPOILED FOOD 

The landlords' claim of "spoiling food in the refrigerator" is a vague and unsubstantiated allegation that fails to meet the legal requirements for a valid claim. The landlords provide no photos, description of the extent of the issue, or costs related to the cleanup. This lack of specificity makes it impossible for the tenant to respond to the claim in any meaningful way. Furthermore, the landlords have not provided any photos or other evidence to support their claim, relying solely on vague and unsubstantiated allegations.
This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to inflate the damages and to unlawfully retain a portion of the security deposit. The landlords' failure to provide specific details and supporting evidence is not just a procedural error; it's a clear indication of their intent to circumvent the law and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds. The landlords' claim of "spoiled food" is a vague and unsubstantiated allegation that fails to meet the legal requirements for a valid claim.
6.28 ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: MISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS
The landlords' claim of "missing and damaged artwork, furnishings, and housewares inventory list items" is a vague and unsubstantiated allegation that fails to meet the legal requirements for a valid claim. The landlords provide no details regarding which items were allegedly missing or damaged, nor do they provide any evidence of the original condition of the items. This lack of specificity makes it impossible for the tenant to respond to the claim in any meaningful way.
The landlords have not provided an inventory list, despite claiming that one exists, nor have they provided any photos or other evidence to support their claim, relying solely on vague and unsubstantiated allegations. This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to inflate the damages and to unlawfully retain a portion of the security deposit. The landlords' failure to provide specific details and supporting evidence is not just a procedural error; it's a clear indication of their intent to circumvent the law and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds. The landlords' claim of "missing and damaged items" is a vague and unsubstantiated allegation that fails to meet the legal requirements for a valid claim.
This detailed analysis, far exceeding the original document's length, provides a comprehensive overview of the landlords' violations. We have meticulously documented every misstep, every act of deception, and every breach of their legal obligations. This is not just a case of simple noncompliance; it's a pattern of calculated misconduct that demands a strong and decisive response. We will use this information
81
to build a case that will hold the landlords accountable for their actions and secure maximum legal and financial recourse for the tenant.
6.29 ALLEGED ABANDONMENT OF PROPERTY: MISREPRESENTATION OF TEXT MESSAGE 

Luther Rollins, the landlord, engaged in a calculated misrepresentation of the tenant's text message, aiming to fabricate a narrative of abandonment and justify the unlawful retention of the tenant's personal property. Rollins selectively quoted the tenant's message, using the phrase "I'm leaving town tonight indefinitely" while omitting crucial context: "This is the only opportunity I have to collect the remaining belongings from your property. I appreciate your cooperation in this matter, and I thank you for your understanding." This omission is not merely an oversight; it is a calculated act of deception intended to mislead and create a false impression of abandonment.
The full text clearly demonstrates the tenant's intent to retrieve their belongings, not abandon them. This misrepresentation blatantly circumvents Florida Statute §715.104, which requires landlords to provide written notice and a reasonable opportunity for retrieval before disposing of or converting a tenant's personal property. This is a deliberate act of bad faith, undermining the landlord's credibility and exposing them to liability for conversion.
Luther Rollins has egregiously misrepresented a text message from the tenant, suggesting a false narrative of abandonment regarding the tenant's possessions. By selectively quoting and omitting critical context, the landlord has created a misleading impression that the tenant willingly forsook their belongings. However, the complete contents of the message underscore the tenant's clear intention to retrieve
their belongings.
The tenant articulated:
1 > "Hi Luther,
'Im leaving town tonight indefinitely. This is the only opportunity I have to collect the remaining
belongings from your property.
cooperation in this matter, understanding."
I appreciate your and I thank you for your
This deliberate misrepresentation by the landlord is a calculated attempt to evade accountability for the unlawful retention and conversion of the tenant's property. Such actions reflect a lack of integrity and exemplify bad faith, as the landlord's distortion of the tenant's words seeks to bolster a fundamentally meritless defense.
6.30 FAILURE TO MAKE REPAIRS: TENANT'S PROACTIVE ACTIONS

Due to the landlord's ongoing negligence, the tenant was compelled to undertake essential repairs. The landlord consistently disregarded critical maintenance issues, notably a severely clogged kitchen sink, compelling the tenant to rectify the problem independently. This scenario exemplifies a troubling pattern of neglect, forcing the tenant to handle various maintenance concerns to maintain a habitable living environment.
82
The landlord's persistent inaction and refusal to comply with their legal obligations under Florida Statute §83.51-to maintain properties in a safe and livable conditionrequired the tenant to assume responsibility for necessary maintenance tasks. The tenant undertook these actions solely to ensure the property remained habitable.
These actions included pruning an overgrown jackfruit tree and conducting other repairs, which the landlord later questioned despite their failure to act.
By failing to perform these essential repairs, the landlord neglected their responsibilities and breached the implied warranty of habitability, crucial for tenant rights to a safe and livable home. Such negligence is legally unacceptable and highlights the importance of landlord accountability in upholding housing standards.
The tenant, Stephen Boerner, was consistently forced to undertake repairs due to the landlord's negligence, evidencing a clear breach of the implied warranty of habitability. The landlord's neglect of maintenance issues, including the clogged kitchen sink that rendered one side unusable for over two weeks, compelled the tenant to resolve the issue, incurring costs and inconvenience rightfully owed to the landlord.
This is not an isolated incident; it establishes a pattern of neglect regarding future maintenance issues. The landlord's unwillingness to comply with Florida Statute §83.51 led to the tenant tackling essential maintenance tasks, including pruning the jackfruit tree and performing other repairs, which the landlord later questioned. This is not mere oversight; it is deliberate neglect that forced the tenant to assume responsibilities that belong to the landlord. By failing to make necessary repairs, the landlord breached the implied warranty of habitability, resulting in an unsafe and unsanitary environment for the tenant. This infringement constitutes a fundamental breach of their legal obligations, exposing the landlord to liability for damages.
6.31 LANDLORD VIOLATION OF STATUTE 83.67
The landlord, Luther Rollins, is accused of violating Florida Statute 83.67, which prohibits landlords from converting tenant property for personal use or failing to notify tenants in writing about the status of abandoned personal property.
This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate act of disregard for the
Instead, the landlord used the tenant's Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill as a "barbecue" amenity in rental advertisements, a blatant act of conversion that demonstrates a clear intent to benefit from the tenant's property without their consent.
This is not a case of simple possession; it's a deliberate act of conversion that exposes the landlord to significant legal and financial liabilities. The landlord's offer of $500 for the personal property, far below its depreciated value, can be seen as an implicit admission of liability for conversion, a tacit acknowledgment that they had no right to retain or use the tenant's belongings.
The landlord's attempt to shift the burden of proof by asking the tenant to prove that they did not abandon their personal property is a clear misrepresentation of Florida law, which places the burden on the landlord to prove that they have followed the proper procedures for handling abandoned property. This is not a case of simple
statute.
83
misunderstanding; it's a calculated attempt to evade their legal obligations and to unlawfully retain or dispose of the tenant's personal property.
Florida Statute 83.67 explicitly prohibits landlords from converting tenant property for personal use or neglecting to provide written notification to tenants regarding the status of abandoned personal property. In the present situation, the landlord is facing allegations of violating this statutory provision. It has been documented that the landlord failed to issue the necessary written notice to the tenant concerning items they left behind.
Furthermore, it is reported that the landlord misappropriated the tenant's grill, marketing it as a "bar becue" amenity in rental advertisements. This act constitutes a clear conversion of the tenant's property, as it demonstrates the landlord's unauthorized use of belongings that rightfully belong to the tenant.
Additionally, the landlord's offer of $500 for the recovery of the personal property may be interpreted as an implicit acknowledgment of liability for the act of conversion.
The circumstances also reveal an attempt by the landlord to improperly shift the burden of proof onto the tenant. It is the landlord's responsibility to substantiate that the tenant's personal property was indeed abandoned or was not present, rather than expecting the tenant to prove the negative stance of abandonment. Thus, the landlord's actions raise significant legal concerns regarding compliance with Florida's statutory requirements regarding tenant property.
6.32 LANDLORD VIOLATION OF STATUTE 715.109 

The landlord's failure to comply with the requirements for handling a tenant's abandoned property under Florida Statute §715.104 directly triggers the liability provisions of Florida Statute 715.109. This statute stipulates that a landlord who does not comply with the requirements of part II of chapter 715 is liable to the former tenant for actual damages or three months' rent, whichever is greater, and costs of the action.
This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a direct consequence of the landlord's failure to follow the law. The landlord's failure to provide the legally required written notice regarding personal property left behind, coupled with their subsequent use of the tenant's grill in rental advertisements, constitutes a clear violation of the statute.
This violation entitles the tenant to either actual damages or three months' rent, whichever is greater, in addition to the cost of the legal action. This is not a minor infraction; it's a significant legal breach that exposes the landlord to substantial financial liabilities. This statutory violation further underscores the landlord's disregard for legal obligations and their willingness to act outside the bounds of the law.
6.33 CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: VAGUE AND LACKING
The landlord's initial claim on the security deposit was not merely vague; it was a deliberate attempt to obscure the true nature of their claims and to prevent the tenant from making an informed response. This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a calculated strategy to avoid accountability and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds. The notice failed to provide specific details, line items, or detailed reasoning for the deductions, relying instead on broad, unsubstantiated accusations.
84
The use of vague language such as "excessive garbage," "damage to walls," and "missing items" without providing any supporting evidence or specific locations, is not sufficient to meet the legal requirements. This lack of specificity is not a minor oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to circumvent the law and to deny the tenant their right to due process. The claim was made with "broadbrush stroke, language and accusations," a tactic designed to intimidate and confuse the tenant, rather than to provide a legitimate basis for withholding the security deposit. The absence of supporting documentation, such as receipts or photographs, further compounds this violation, demonstrating a clear intent to avoid accountability and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds. This is not a case of simple negligence; it's a deliberate act of bad faith that undermines the entire claim on the security deposit.
6.34 CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: USE OF FUTURE TENSE 

The landlord's use of speculative language about future costs in the security deposit claim is a clear violation of Florida law, which requires landlords to provide actual costs incurred, not speculative future expenses. This is not a case of simple misinterpretation; it's a deliberate attempt to inflate the damages and to unlawfully retain a portion of the security deposit.
The landlord's notice spoke of "repairs that would have to be done and clean up that would have to be made," using future tense wording to justify deductions that were not yet incurred. This is not a minor procedural error; it's a calculated attempt to circumvent the law and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds.
The tenant correctly points out that the property was listed for rent shortly after move-out, suggesting that repairs could not have been completed at the time the landlord made the claim. This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to mislead the tenant and to unlawfully retain their security deposit. The use of future tense wording is not just a procedural error; it's a clear indication of the landlord's intent to act in bad faith and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds.
6.35 CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: ABSENCE OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

The landlord's failure to include any supporting documentation to substantiate their claims is a blatant violation of Florida Statute §83.49(3), which requires landlords to provide an itemized list of damages claimed against the security deposit, including receipts or estimates. This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to avoid accountability and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds.
Despite claiming to possess photos, receipts, and witness accounts, the landlord did not provide them to the tenant, a clear indication of their intent to conceal the true nature of their claims. The landlord stated that they "possess evidence (e.g., photos, receipts, and witness accounts) but fails to include this evidence," a tactic designed to intimidate and confuse the tenant, rather than to provide a legitimate basis for withholding the security deposit. The absence of supporting evidence is not just a procedural error; it's a fundamental breach of their legal obligations that renders their
85
claim on the security deposit invalid. This is not a case of simple negligence; it's a calculated act of bad faith that undermines the entire claim on the security deposit.
6.36 CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: NO BASELINE FOR COMPARISON

The landlords' claims regarding missing or damaged items are fundamentally unenforceable because no inventory list was provided at the start of the tenancy, a fatal flaw that undermines their entire claim. This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to circumvent the law and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds.
Without a detailed inventory at the start of the tenancy, there is no way to determine what items were present or their condition when the tenant took possession of the property.
The lease merely referred to "all furnishings and personal property" without any itemization, a tactic designed to create ambiguity and to make it impossible for the tenant to verify the accuracy of the landlord's claims. This is not a minor procedural error; it's a fundamental breach of their legal obligations that renders their claim on the security deposit invalid. The case Johnson v. Bakerestablishes that without evidence of the property's condition at the beginning of the tenancy, a landlord cannot prove that a tenant caused damages, a principle that directly applies to this case. This is not a case of simple negligence; it's a calculated act of bad faith that undermines the entire claim on the security deposit.
6.37 CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: UNREASONABLE ACCOUNTABILITY

The landlords' attempt to hold the tenant accountable for issues that they were not responsible for or for which they had no control is a clear indication of their intent to act in bad faith and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds. This is not a case of simple misunderstanding; it's a deliberate attempt to shift the blame and to avoid their own legal obligations. The tenant is not responsible for normal wear and tear, and the landlord's claims regarding damage to the walls, spoiled food, and trash were deemed to be normal wear and tear, or unusual circumstances beyond the tenant's control.
entered the property through an unsecure gate that the landlord had failed to repair.
The tenant was also not responsible for trash removal delays caused by a severe storm.
The landlord failed to acknowledge their own negligence or to provide the tenant with the opportunity to resolve any legitimate issues before imposing a claim on the security deposit. This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to inflate the damages and to unlawfully retain a portion of the security deposit. The landlords' attempt to hold the tenant accountable for issues that they were not responsible for is a clear indication of their intent to act in bad faith and to unlawfully retain the

7 Detailed Analysis of Business Entities and Ownership Structure

A. North Carolina Registration - Amarlu Enterprises:
The document correctly identifies three assumed business names, all registered on July 7, 2023, in Catawba County, North Carolina, under the same registration: • Amarlu Company (SOS ID: 2668508): This assumed name is clearly intended to project a false image of a legitimate company to tenants.
• Amarlu Consulting (SOS ID: 2668509): The term "consulting" adds a layer of deception, giving a veneer of professionalism to their shady practices.
• Amarlu Enterprises (SOS ID: 2668507): This is the primary assumed name used in correspondence with tenants, and the most relevant to the Florida lease agreement. These registrations are for "assumed business names," NOT properly formed LLC's or Corporations, the legal form that should have been filed with the North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State.Instead, Rollins and Polk chose the registration of assumed business name, this legal tactic is usually used when the entity does not want to declare legal responsibility for the operations, or the entity is not actually conducting any business activity.
The legal capacity is noted as "indi vidual," indicating that Luther Rollins, Jr. and Mary O. Polk are personally using these assumed names to conduct business with no veil to shield them from personal responsibility. The report correctly identifies their

primary jurisdiction as Catawba County, North Carolina with Donna Hicks Spencer, Register of Deeds, as the recording official. We will need to confirm that this is the only location where they registered the entity.
B. Florida's Regulatory Requirements for Foreign Entities
This is where Rollins and Polk's house of cards starts to fall apart. The report accurately highlights the significant failure of Amarlu Enterprises to register as a foreign entity with the Florida Division of Corporations, which directly violates Florida Statutes § 605.0902. This is not just a minor technicality; it forms the foundation of the landlord's illegal activities in Florida. The statute requires that any out-of-state entity conducting business in Florida, including collecting rental income, must register with the state.
The following key elements from the case data further solidify the case: * Dual-state operation: Luther Rollins' status as "co- registrant" and his "dual-state operations (NC/FL)" indicate that he knew or should have known that Florida registration is required. * Lack of State-Level Registration: This is the foundational violation, rendering their Florida operations inherently illegitimate. * Missing Foreign Entity Qualifications: They failed to fulfill the essential requirements for conducting business as a foreign entity. * Non-Compliant Interstate Commerce: The report also indicates the non-compliance with interstate commerce regulations.
This failure has severe ramifications: * Unenforceable Contracts: Any lease agreement where an unregistered entity is involved is immediately tainted, leaving the
87
tenants in a far stronger position for claims. * Liability for Penalties: The landlords exposed themselves to potential fines and penalties for violating the statute by unlawfully doing business in Florida without registration.
III. Address Discrepancies and Compliance Analysis: A Tangled Web of Deception The address variations used by these landlords expose a troubling pattern of increasing informality, deliberate obfuscation, and blatant violation of North Carolina and Federal laws. We are dealing with deliberate manipulation, designed to evade scrutiny and complicate their paper trails.
8 Detailed Review of Violations 

• reference mark sieg, therapist mention his testimony 1. Instances of Future Tense Language
Upon review of the October 1, 2024 letter, numerous examples of future tense language invalidate the landlord's claim on the security deposit under Florida Statute $83.49(3)(a), which mandates that landlords provide a timely, itemized statement of actual damages incurred, not anticipated or speculative costs. Below are the specific instances of future tense language:
1. "Extensive cleaning will be required"
• The use of "will be required" indicates no cleaning had been performed or incurred costs at the time of the letter. Florida law prohibits speculative or future expenses as a basis for deductions.
1. "Repairs to the walls and surfaces will be necessary"
• The phrase "will be necessary" again refers to future, unverified repairs. No receipts, invoices, or photos of the walls were included to support this claim.
1. "Garbage and trash removal will be required"
• Stating that "removal will be had taken place by October 1, 2024.

1. "Replacement costs will be calculated"
• "Will be calculated" implies future evaluation and not an itemized list of existin, replacement costs. This is a direct violation of Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) 1. "Yard and landscaping will need restoration"
• "Will need restoration"

refers to hypothetical work and costs that had not yet
1. Timeline of Events
The timeline further undermines the landlord's claims and raises significant questions:
88
• Early September 2024: The property inspection was allegedly performed. This is supported by Steinberger's email dated September 5, 2024, where he states his "professional opinion" that the entire security deposit should not be refunded due to
• Key Issue: This opinion was speculative, future oriented, and lacks credibility as it did not include receipts, photos, or verifiable assessments.
• October 1, 2024: The landlord drafted the claim on the security deposit.
• Issue: Despite a full month passing since the inspection, the claim still refers to future tense languagefor anticipated cleaning, repairs, and other work. If damages had been as severe as described, why had no work been completed or documented? • October 2, 2024: The letter was mailed.
• Issue: By this point, the landlord had ample time to itemize damages, gather receipts, or document repairs. The reliance on speculative costs is a violation of the statutory requirement to provide actual, itemized expenses.
• October 5, 2024: The property was relisted for rent and advertised as available immediately.
• Key Issue: Relisting the property just three days after mailing the claim demonstrates that the property was already in rentable condition. This directly contradicts the landlord's assertion that "extensive cleaning" or "restoration" was still necessary.
Conflict of Interest: Zach Steinberger's Role
Zach Steinberger's involvement as both the listing agent for the home and the landlord's representative throughout the lease term raises serious concerns about conflict of interest and the validity of his claims.

1. Dual Roles and Financial Incentive

• Steinberger facilitated both the listing and the rental of the property, earning commissions for these transactions.
• His ongoing financial relationship with the landlord incentivizes him to align with the landlord's interests, compromising his neutrality in assessing tenant-related issues.
1. Questionable Professional Opinion
In Steinberger's September 5, 2024 email, he stated:
"It is my professional opinion to not refund the security deposit... you will need the $4,500 deposit to bring the property back to the standard and condition that it was in when tenants moved in."
• Steinberger's opinion relied on future tense language, such as "will need," indicating speculative rather than verifiable costs.
• Steinberger, as a realtor, lacks the qualifications to assess or determine property damages beyond superficial observations. His opinion is non-binding and holds minimal legal weight unless substantiated by licensed contractors or appraisers.
1. Unauthorized Practice of Law
89
• If Steinberger advised the landlord on how to pursue legal claims or interpret the lease agreement, he may have engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, a violation of Florida regulations. Realtors are expressly prohibited from giving legal advice under Article 13 of the National Association of Realtors (NAR) Code of Ethics.
1. Ethical Violations
Steinberger's dual role violates the principles of neutrality required under the NAR Code of Ethics:
• Article 1: Realtors must act honestly and fairly with all parties.
• Article 11: Realtors must operate within their expertise and disclose conflicts of interest.
• Article 12: Realtors may not make false or misleading statements about property
Steinberger's financial incentive to support Luther's claims, combined with his speculative opinion, undermines the objectivity and validity of his involvement.
Legal Violations and Demands
The landlord's use of future tense language, combined with the timeline and Steinberger's conflicted role, invalidates the claim on the security deposit. The following violations are clear:
1. Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a):
• The landlord failed to provide an itemized statement of actual costs, instead relying on speculative and future expenses.
1. Florida Statute §715.104 (regarding personal property):
The landlord failed to provide proper written notice for the retrieval of person.
roperty left on the premises, which has since been converted for unauthorized us 1. Conflict of Interest and Lack of Credibility:
• Steinberger's dual role, financial dependency, and speculative statements call into question the impartiality and reliability of the landlord's claims.
Conclusion and Settlement Offer
Given the clear statutory violations, conflicts of interest, and the landlord's failure to substantiate claims, I propose the following resolution:
Settlement Proposal
1. Full Return of Security Deposit: $4,500.00
2. Compensation for Personal Property: $4,210.62 (based on depreciated value) 3. Non-Refundable Pet Fee: $500.00

Total Settlement Demand: $9,210.62
This offer provides a reasonable opportunity to resolve the matter amicably without further legal escalation. Should you fail to accept this settlement within 15 days of receiving this letter, I will proceed with the following actions:
• File a formal complaint in Florida County Court seeking:
• Full recovery of the security deposit
90
• Compensation for converted personal property
• Statutory damages, including treble damages where applicable
• Court costs and attorney's fees
• Submit complaints to the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation and the National Association of Realtors regarding Steinberger's conflict of interest and ethical violations.
This is your final opportunity to resolve this dispute amicably. I urge you to carefully consider the implications of further noncompliance with Florida law.
This version incorporates all the necessary arguments, evidence, and statutory references while also elaborating on the timeline of events, highlighting the conflict of interest regarding Steinberger, and making a persuasive demand for resolution.
• inventory list
A. Security Deposit Handling
Your notice alleging $4,500 in damages was vague, non-itemized, and failed to include any supporting evidence. This omission is not a minor technicality: it is a clear statutory violation. Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a) requires landlords to provide written notice of any claims against the deposit within 30 days of lease termination and to detail the nature and amount of each damage or cost. Your letter lacked specificity, offered no receipts or photographs, and thus prevented me from making an informed response. Courts have routinely held that failing to provide sufficient detail invalidates the landlord's claim entirely, requiring a full return of the security deposit.
Your conduct amounts to bad faith withholding. You knew or should have known that generic, unsupported accusations (like "excessive garbage" or "wall damage") do not meet the legal standard. Because you had ample opportunity and legal training to comply correctly, your failure suggests a deliberate tactic to retain funds to which you are not entitled. As a result, I am entitled not only to the full deposit return, but potentially to additional damages, including statutory penalties and attorney's fees. Florida courts, considering bad faith, may award treble damages under certain circumstances. Your professional background as a lawyer strongly supports a finding of bad faith, as ignorance of the law is not plausible.
B. Negligent Maintenance and Habitability Failures
The lease agreement and Florida Statute §83.51 impose upon you a duty to maintain the property in a safe, habitable condition. Yet, from the very start of my tenancy, you neglected fundamental maintenance. The severely clogged kitchen sink required my intervention due to your non-responsiveness, forcing me to expend time, money, and effort to restore basic functionality. More egregiously, you failed to secure the property against foreseeable intrusions. The backyard gate, which you acknowledged was deteriorated, remained unrepaired despite my requests, enabling a trespasser with a substantial criminal history to gain access to my home. This break-in was not merely a scare; it was a dangerous, traumatizing event that re ignited and worsened my PTSD.
91
Your refusal to rectify critical safety issues or to undertake prompt, professional repairs shows a reckless disregard for tenant well-being and flouts the implied warranty of habitability. Florida law does not excuse a landlord's inaction merely because maintaining a property is inconvenient. By ignoring repeated requests for fence and gate repairs, and by failing to ensure proper locks or security measures after a documented incident, you violated the statutory standards and breached the lease. The resulting mental anguish and emotional distress I suffered, combined with the tangible risk to my personal safety and property, are factors that strengthen claims for compensatory and potentially punitive damages.
C. Unlawful Conversion of Personal Property
You withheld my personal property that I attempted to retrieve after vacating.
Per Florida Statutes §§715.104 and subsequent sections, a landlord who finds tenant property on the premises must issue proper written notice and permit retrieval within a statutory period. You did not provide any such notice. Instead, you ignored my attempts to reclaim my belongings and proceeded to market the property's backyard amenities- including my Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill and related accessories-to prospective new tenants. This act is legally defined as conversion: exercising dominion and control over my property in a manner inconsistent with my ownership rights.
In Goodwin v. Alexatos, Florida's courts affirm that unauthorized use and retention of another's property is conversion, entitling the owner to recover the property's full value. In this case, that value is approximately $4,200 after depreciation. Because your actions were willful and for personal gain (advertising the grill to enhance your rental listing), I am also positioned to seek punitive damages for conversion. The law treats deliberate, unjustifiable interference with property rights as a serious offense.
By doubling down on ignoring my retrieval requests and profiting from my property's use, you place yourself squarely within the zone of heightened liability.
D. Harassment, Coercive Communication, and Misrepresentation After receiving my formal dispute letter, rather than providing the requested documentation or good-faith negotiation, you attempted to coerce me into phone calls.
You sent multiple voicemails and messages strongly implying that both parties "are supposed to" talk on the phone. This is factually and legally untrue. Florida landlordtenant law imposes no such requirement. My insistence on written communication is both my right and the recommended practice for clarity and record-keeping. Your attempts to force a phone conversation, given your attorney status, appear intended to intimidate, avoid leaving a paper trail, and corner me into concessions I would not make if protected by documentation.
Your misrepresentation of legal requirements and your repeated, unsolicited attempts to engage in a less documented medium constitute harassment. When considered alongside your selective quotation of my messages (such as truncating my September 4 text to misrepresent it as an abandonment of property rather than a retrieval attempt), this behavior clearly indicates bad faith. Harassment of tenants is expressly discouraged by Florida statutes, and your actions, once again, could war rant enhanced judicial remedies and potentially form the basis for ethical complaint with the bar associations in states where you hold a license.
E. Violations Arising from Unregistered Business Entity Operations
92
You required me to make rent payments to "Amarlu Enterprises," a North Carolina entity not registered as a foreign LLC or business in Florida as mandated by §605.0902.
Conducting business without proper registration is unlawful and questions the validity of the lease and all financial transactions stemming from it. By collecting $45,000 in total rent through a non-registered, undisclosed entity, you have exposed yourself to possible regulatory penalties, tax liabilities, and legal ramifications that may void the enforceability of the lease terms. This underscores the magnitude of your misconduct, revealing a pattern of deceptive and illegal practices far beyond mere landlord-tenant disputes. It invites broader scrutiny from state agencies and the IRS, increasing the complexity and potential severity of consequences you face.
III. Professional Ethics and Regulatory Implications
As an attorney, you are held to a higher standard. The Florida Bar, as well as the North Carolina and Missouri bar associations where you are licensed, maintain codes of professional conduct that prohibit dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation.
Engaging in prolonged, willful violations of landlord-tenant statutes, misleading communications, and noncompliance with foreign entity requirements suggests not only unethical conduct but also harm to the public trust in the legal profession.
I will report your actions to these professional bodies. This is non-negotiable and separate from any settlement of the financial claims. Even if you choose to settle monetarily, your disregard for statutory obligations, your exploitation of your position as a lawyer, and your intimidation tactics must be brought to the attention of the appropriate regulatory and ethical oversight entities. This is a matter of principle and public protection, ensuring that similar abuses do not continue against other tenants.
IV. Damages and Settlement Offer
Given the extraordinary range and severity of violations, I will no longer consider any partial, token offer. Your previous $2,000 proposal was an insult, given that my claims now extend well beyond the security deposit to the entire lease amount, personal property value, and other compensatory damages.
1. Lease Amount and Security Deposit: I demand the full amount of the lease payments (4,500), and the value of my personal property (500 pet deposit. This amounts to $54,200. This figure excludes treble damages, punitive damages, emotional distress damages, and attorney's fees, which I would otherwise seek in court.
2. Independent Reporting: Regardless of your choice, I will report your actions to the Missouri Bar, the North Carolina Bar, and the Florida Bar Associations, as well as to the Florida Department of Revenue and the North Carolina Department of
track that will proceed irrespective of any financial settlement. I am not offering to refrain from this reporting in exchange for payment because that would be improper. Instead, I am fulfilling a civic and ethical duty to ensure accountability.
3. Timelines and Compliance: If you wish to avoid litigation seeking even larger sums and extensive public scrutiny in a courtroom, you must remit the full 54,200, given your bad faith and professional background.
V. Legal and Moral Rationale for My Approach
93
My approach- demanding the entire lease amount, the entire deposit, full personal property value, and reporting your professional misconduct—is not vindictive, but it is proportionate to your relentless noncompliance, your intimidation strategies, and your unwillingness to act as a lawful, responsible landlord. As an attorney, you should have known better at every turn. Instead, you chose to exploit both your knowledge of the law and your perceived leverage over a tenant who simply sought a safe, habitable home and a fair return of their security deposit.
If you had been responsive, honest, and cooperative, this matter would not have escalated. Instead, your continued disregard for statutes, attempts to coerce phone conversations, misrepresentation of legal obligations, and failure to address security and maintenance issues have forced me to take a firm and fully-documented stance.
VI. Summary of Demands and Consequences
1. Pay 45,000 in total rent (reflecting my claim to void or recoup due to your misconduct), 4,200 personal property value, and $500 pet deposit. By doing so, you resolve the direct financial aspects of my claims. This is a significant concession on my part, as I am declining, for the sake of resolving this matter swiftly, to also demand treble or punitive damages in this immediate settlement.
2. Understand that my duty to report your conduct to professional and regulatory authorities stands: Paying the demanded amount will not prevent me from filing complaints with the relevant bar associations and revenue departments. This is a separate and independent track. It is not and cannot be part of any negotiation.
3. Failure to pay timely will result in litigation: Should you choose not to settle for 54,200, including punitive and treble damages, as well as emotional distress damages and attorney's fees. Additionally, courtroom proceedings are public, which may further damage your reputation, especially in light of your attorney status.

VII. Conclusion
You have left me no choice but to take this all-encompassing action due to your repeated and willful violations of Florida law, your professional duties, and your ethical obligations. The evidence is overwhelming, the statutes are clear, and your position as an attorney removes any plausible claim of ignorance. I have documented each violation, explained the statutory basis for each claim, and demonstrated how courts and oversight bodies are likely to react to your misconduct.
This letter is your final notice and your last opportunity to mitigate the substantial harm you have caused yourself by refusing to follow the law. If you fail to comply with these demands, I will have no hesitation in pursuing the full extent of litigation
and regulatory measures available.
Please govern yourself accordingly.
I am writing in direct response to your letter dated November 8, 2024, and to address your prior "Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit" sent in October 2024. My purpose is twofold: (1) to provide a final, comprehensive legal rebuttal to your claims and conduct; and (2) to present clear options for resolving this dispute before I pursue all available legal and regulatory remedies
94
Over the course of my tenancy at 2649 Tifton St. S., I have devoted significant effort to understanding and documenting your numerous violations of Florida's landlord-tenant statutes. Regrettably, my review of these laws, combined with substantial time invested in assembling evidence, has only confirmed that your actions were not merely negligent oversights. Instead, they appear to be calculated misrepresentations and statutory breaches, culminating in bad faith withholding of my security deposit, unlawful retention and use of my personal property, and a pattern of harassment that exacerbated my pre-existing PTSD.
Your profession as a licensed attorney in North Carolina and Missouri imposes on you an enhanced obligation to understand and follow the law. Yet the record shows that you repeatedly disregarded mandatory legal requirements. The violations documented below are neither subtle nor isolated. Taken in their entirety, they show a deliberate pattern: you failed to provide itemized documentation for withholding my security deposit, never issued legally required notice for personal property you retained, leveraged unregistered foreign entities to collect rent in Florida, and pressured me repeatedly via phone calls and voicemails despite my clear requests to maintain all communications in writing.
Your most recent letter's "settlement offer" of $2,000 comprising a partial refund of the security deposit and a nominal amount for my personal property-—is not only legally insufficient but insulting in light of the high damages, statutory penalties, and potential professional consequences you face. I am rejecting that offer outright.
Instead, I am making a final demand that reflects the gravity of your misconduct, as explained below.
I. Overview of Violations & Core Legal Framework
A. Florida Statutes Governing Security Deposits and Property Handling Under Florida Statutes §§83.49 and 83.51, landlords must adhere to strict timelines and evidentiary requirements when withholding a tenant's security deposit. Specifically, §83.49(3) demands that, within 30 days of lease termination, a landlord must provide an itemized, good-faith notice of any claims against the deposit. Failing this, the landlord forfeits the right to withhold, and the full deposit must be returned promptly. You neither provided the requisite specificity nor timely produced evidence supporting your claims.
Similarly, for personal property left behind, Florida Statutes §§715.10-715.111 require the landlord to issue proper written notice and allow a retrieval window before disposing of or claiming the tenant's items as abandoned. You never provided such notice. Instead, you ignored my documented requests to reclaim my belongings and then advertised them as amenities for new tenants— an act of conversion under Florida
B. Case Law and Burden of Proof
Florida courts have repeatedly emphasized that landlords must meet their statutory burdens. Cases like Johnson v. Baker affirm that without a proper inventory or baseline condition report, a landlord cannot prove tenant-caused damages. Durene v Alcime underscores the necessity of timely, itemized disclosures. By failing to meet these standards, you have rendered your claims unenforceable and triggered penalties that the statutes impose to deter such misconduct.
95
C. Unregistered Foreign Entity Issues and Fraudulent Practices You instructed me to pay rent to "Amarlu Enterprises," a North Carolina company unregistered as a foreign entity in Florida. Florida Statute §605.0902 requires out-ofstate companies to register before doing business here. By funneling $45,000 in rent through an unregistered entity undisclosed in the lease, you violated state law. Your omission from the lease of this entity and its assumed names is a misrepresentation that may constitute fraud. This alone undermines the enforceability of the lease and
any claims you assert based on it.
II. Specific Violations Detailed
1. Improper Security Deposit Handling:
• You withheld my entire $4,500 security deposit without providing a timely, itemized statement of costs as required by §83.49(3)(a).
• Your "notice" was vague, lacked itemization, and did not meet the statutory standard. Courts have consistently ruled that such generic notices fail to justify withholding any portion of a deposit.
• As a result, you forfeited your right to withhold any funds. By continuing to do so, you are acting in bad faith, exposing yourself to liability for treble damages, attorney's fees, and costs.
1. Unlawful Retention and Conversion of Personal Property: • I left certain personal property behind due to storm-related delays and specifically attempted to schedule retrieval. You never responded or provided the required abandonment notice mandated by 8715.104.
• Instead of allowing me to retrieve my belongings, you converted my property to your own use, as evidenced by rental listings touting "barbequing" amenities directly referencing my Weber Spirit E-310 grill and related equipment.
• Conversion law in Florida (see Goodwin v. Alexatos) allows me to recover the full value of my items. Given your willful misconduct, I may also seek punitive damages.
1. Negligence and Habitability Concerns:
• From the clogged kitchen sink you never fixed to the dangerous condition of the backyard fence gate that allowed a violent trespasser into the property, you repeatedly failed in your duty to maintain a safe, habitable environment under §83.51.
• Your neglect forced me to undertake self-help remedies at my own expense and exposed me to direct physical and emotional harm. The March 26, 2024 break-in, facilitated by your ignored maintenance requests, exacerbated my PTSD and compromised my family's safety.
1. Harassment and Misrepresentation:
• After receiving my dispute letter, you attempted to coerce me into phone calls and even sent a text implying "we are both supposed to" talk by phone an outright misrepresentation of the law. Florida's landlord-tenant statutes do not require phone negotiations.
96
• These tactics are a form of harassment. Given your background as an attorney, your insistence on undocumented verbal resolutions appears designed to intimidate and avoid creating a paper trail, further demonstrating bad faith.
• This harassment, combined with misaddressed certified mail and selective quoting of my texts to fabricate claims of abandonment, shows a pattern of manipulation that only strengthens my entitlement to punitive and statutory damages.
III. Impact of Your Attorney Status and Professional Obligations As a licensed attorney, you must know that ignoring statutory mandates, withholding evidence, and converting tenant property is not only unlawful but unethical. Your violations may constitute breaches of the Florida Bar Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rules 4-8.4(c) (involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and 4-8.4(d) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).
I reserve the right to file complaints with the Missouri and North Carolina Bar Associations, as well as the Florida Bar, exposing your deliberate attempts to circumvent landlord-tenant laws and your professional responsibilities.
IV. Financial Breakdown of Claims
Given the severity and multiplicity of violations, I am entitled to significant
1. Full Lease Amount and Security Deposit:
• Due to the underlying misrepresentation and possible unenforceability of the lease, as well as withholding the entire deposit without justification, I have grounds to demand return of the full 45,000. While I previously considered lesser amounts, your ongoing noncompliance and bad faith behavior warrant a more comprehensive
1. Value of Personal Property:
• My personal items you converted, including the Weber grill and related accessories, are valued at approximately $4,200 after depreciation. You must compensate
me fully for these items.
1. Pet Security Deposit:
• You must also return the $500 pet fee. Given the lease's invalidation and your failure to comply with statutory obligations, retaining this fee is no longer justifiable.
1. Statutory and Punitive Damages:
• Florida Statute §§83.49 and 715.109 allow for treble damages and other penalties if bad faith is established. Your knowing, repeated violations almost guarantee such a finding.
1. Emotional Distress and Other Damages:
• The aggravation of my PTSD, inconvenience, and costs incurred to self-remedy maintenance issues could support additional claims for compensatory and possibly
punitive damages.
Total Demand:
97
Base amounts include 4,500 (security deposit), 500 (pet fee), totaling 54,200 immediately, you can avoid litigation seeking much higher amounts, including treble and punitive damages.
V. Proposed Two-Track Approach
I have decided on two distinct tracks. You may resolve the financial dispute, but I will not be deterred from pursuing professional and regulatory reporting: 

1. First Track-Settlement:
• To avoid protracted litigation, I offer one final settlement figure of 500 pet deposit.
• By paying $54,200 within fifteen (15) days of receiving this letter, I will release you from further financial liability related to these direct claims. This is a substantial concession, as I am choosing not to pursue punitive or treble damages in this settlement offer.
1. Second Track-Mandatory Reporting of Misconduct:
• Regardless of your decision on the settlement, I will report your actions to the North Carolina Bar, Missouri Bar, and Florida Bar Associations. Your status as an attorney and your willful disregard for statutory obligations demand oversight.
• I will also file complaints with the Florida Department of Revenue and the North Carolina Department of Revenue concerning Amarlu Enterprises' unregistered operation and potential tax violations.
• This reporting is non-negotiable and will not be withdrawn even if you pay the demanded $54,200. The second track is about ensuring accountability beyond the financial dimension.
This two-track approach clarifies that paying $54,200 will not prevent me from reporting your professional misconduct and potential tax violations. I am not offering to refrain from reporting in exchange for payment such an arrangement would be improper. Instead, paying the demanded amount serves only to resolve the financial aspects of the dispute. The professional and regulatory obligations I have to report
misconduct stand independently.
VI. Next Steps
If you choose to settle, remit payment of $54,200 in full within fifteen (15) days of receiving this letter. Acceptable forms of payment include cashier's check or wire transfer, and all communications confirming payment must be in writing If you fail to meet this deadline, I will initiate litigation in Florida Circuit Court.
Upon settlement or, failing that, upon the commencement of litigation, I will also proceed with reporting your conduct to the relevant bar associations and state departments. Once again, these reports are not contingent upon the settlement. They are a separate, equally important matter to ensure that your conduct as a landlord
attorney does not go unchecked.
VII. Conclusion
98
Your refusal to follow Florida's landlord-tenant statutes, your misrepresentations, your intimidation tactics, and your wrongful conversion of my property have caused me significant harm, both financially and emotionally. As a licensed attorney, you knew or should have known better. Instead, you chose to flout the law.
This letter serves as your final notice and demand. You have a limited window to address your statutory failures by remitting $54,200 and thus resolving the financial dispute. Regardless of your choice, I will honor my duty to report your unethical conduct to the appropriate professional and regulatory authorities.
Please govern yourself accordingly.
Sincerely, STEPHEN BOERNER
Former Tenant, 2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL 33711

ILLEGAL HANDLING OF TENANT'S PERSONAL PROPERTY
Property Address: 2649 TIFTON ST. S. GULFPORT, FL 33711
--------------
I. Opening Statement
Dear Mr. Rollins:
This letter serves as a formal response, and dispute, to your "Notice
of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit" (hereinafter
referred to as "the Notice") dated October 1, 2024, mailed October 2,
2024, and received by me, Stephen Boerner, the prior tenant, on
October 5, 2024.
Pursuant to Florida Statute §83.49(3)(b), a written response is being
sent on Friday, October 18th, 2024, via USPS Certified Mail within the
legally 15-day timeframe allotted for a tenant's response and
constitutes a formal dispute to your claims on deposit.
Pursuant to Florida Statute §83.49(3)(b), a written response is being
sent on Friday, October 18th, 2024, via USPS Certified Mail within the
legally 15-day timeframe allotted for a tenant's response and
constitutes a formal dispute to your claims on deposit.
Additionally, I am delivering herein my claims against you, the
landlord, for illegal handling of personal property.
This letter outlines in detail the legal and factual basis for my
dispute, addresses each of your claims individually, provides detail
supporting my claims against you, the landlord, and proposes options
for resolution.
II. Overview of Claim on Deposit:
Your Notice purports to justify withholding my entire security deposit
of $4,500 based on an inspection allegedly conducted "on or about
September 4, 2024." The Notice lists several claims of damage or
issues with the property as follows:
Excessive garbage and trash in the front and rear yards
Spoiling food in the refrigerator
Damage to the walls of the premises
Unauthorized hanging lights
Unauthorized removal of wood cabinets, shelving, counters, and other
alterations without landlord consent
Unauthorized whiteboard affixed to exterior wall of the premises
Missing and damaged artwork, furnishings, and housewares inventory
list items
Tenant personal property left in the house, garage, tiki hut, and
front and rear yards
Unauthorized cutting by tenant of the legacy jackfruit tree in the
rear yard (may cause the tree to become diseased, wither and/or die)
Tenant stayed in the premises several days beyond the lease expiration
date
Caused the landlord to be unable to show or relet the premises due to
tenant extended occupancy and overall unclean condition
Extensive cleaning will be required to restore the premises to the
standard and condition that it was in when the tenants moved in at the
start of the lease
I will address individually in its dedicated section of this letter.
However, before delving into the specific claims, it is necessary to
address the overall deficiencies in your Notice and actions, which
render your claim on my security deposit legally invalid.
Given the seriousness of these issues and the clear violations of
Florida law, I request that you respond to this letter within 15 days
of receipt, indicating your preferred option for resolution as
outlined in Section VIII of this letter.
Failure to respond within this timeframe may result in legal action to
recover my security deposit and damages for unlawful retention of
personal property.
III. Detailed Rebuttal of Your Claims & Non-Compliance with Florida
Statute §83.49(3)
A. Failure to Provide Proper Notice
Your Notice fails to comply with Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a) in
several critical aspects:
Lack of Specificity and Itemization:
While Florida law does not require a fully itemized breakdown of every
cost, it does require enough specificity so the tenant can make an
informed response. Your Notice is overly vague, making it impossible
for me to adequately assess or respond. Based on my general
recollection of the property, I will address each claim, though I am
limited by the lack of detail provided in your Notice.
1. Excessive Garbage and Trash in the Front and Rear Yards
Response:
Your claim of “excessive garbage and trash” lacks any specific details
regarding the amount, location, or cost of removal, leaving me with
little to rely on other than my own recollection. Based on my memory,
any trash present at the time of my departure was placed in the
appropriate area for collection, and any excess trash was the result
of a garbage collection delay that was beyond my control. I had
arranged for additional removal services that were subsequently
canceled due to a [storm, municipal delay, etc.]. Without clear
evidence or photos of the trash, I cannot be sure what your claim
refers to, and therefore, I dispute this charge as speculative.
2. Spoiled Food in the Refrigerator
Response:
The allegation of “spoiled food” is similarly vague. You have provided
no photos, description of the extent of the issue, or costs related to
the cleanup. From what I can recall, there were a few perishable items
left in the refrigerator, but nothing that would have caused
significant damage or required anything beyond standard cleaning,
which is typically included in turnover between tenants. Again,
without supporting documentation, I can only rely on my recollection,
and I dispute the necessity of withholding a portion of the security
deposit for what seems like a minor issue.

without supporting documentation, I can only rely on my recollection,
and I dispute the necessity of withholding a portion of the security
deposit for what seems like a minor issue.
3. Damage to the Walls of the Premises
Response:
Your Notice references “damage to the walls,” but it provides no
details regarding which walls were affected, the nature of the damage,
or whether it was interior or exterior. Based on my memory, I recall
minor scuff marks on some walls, which are typical wear and tear for a
one-year tenancy. Florida law is clear that tenants are not liable for
normal wear and tear (see Fipps v. Robinson, 612 So.2d 689 (Fla. 1st
DCA 1993)). Without specifying where or what kind of damage you’re
referring to, I cannot address this claim in any meaningful way. Your
lack of detail prevents me from fully responding, and as such, I
dispute this charge.
I deny causing any damage to the walls beyond normal wear and tear.
Without specific details or photographic evidence, it is impossible to
assess the validity of this claim.
Furthermore, Florida law (e.g., Fipps v. Robinson, 612 So.2d 689 (Fla.
1st DCA 1993)) establishes that tenants are not responsible for normal
wear and tear.
4. Unauthorized Hanging Lights
Response:
I recall installing temporary hanging lights, which were non-permanent
and removed prior to vacating. The claim of damage caused by these
lights is unclear—was there any specific damage documented? As you
have not provided photos or a description of what this damage
entailed, I am left to rely solely on my memory, which tells me that
no damage was left behind from these lights. I can only conclude that
any minor marks would fall under normal wear and tear, which is not
chargeable to the tenant under Florida law.
Further, these lights are located on the personal property Addendum
outlining all personal property that falls under the full list of
illegal held, and converted, personal property as your Notice mentions
personal property left behind pointing to the landlord burden to
respond accordingly with written notice for removal that was not met
by you, the landlord.
5. Unauthorized Removal of Wood Cabinets, Shelving, Counters, and
Other Alterations Without Landlord Consent
Response:
You claim that I made unauthorized alterations, such as the removal of
cabinets or shelving.
Without specifics, I, nor a overriding court authority, can not
appraise this claim.
I require photographic evidence of the alterations—I am unable to
properly assess this claim. Based on my recollection, there were
poorly fixed, unusable fixtures were altered, and therefore, I dispute
a portion of the claim as unsupported and speculative.
6. Unauthorized Whiteboard Affixed to Exterior Wall of the Premises
Response:
While I do recall using a temporary whiteboard, it was attached with
non-permanent methods and was not removed before vacating the
property. This was not trash nor abandoned property, nor was it
"affixed" as it was hanging on a shelf, built accordingly, to avoid
affixation to exteriror walls.
Your claim, stating "affixed" is incorrect and fails to explain
whether the issue is damage to the wall or simply the use of the
whiteboard declaring "affixed" as the assumed reason for such a claim,
which it was not.
Since no documentation or photos of the wall have been provided, I can
only rely on my memory, which tells me that no damage was caused by
this, and personal property left mishandled. I therefore dispute this
claim.
7. Missing and Damaged Artwork, Furnishings, and Housewares Inventory
List Items
Response:
Your Notice mentions “missing and damaged artwork, furnishings, and
housewares,” but it does not specify which items were allegedly
missing or damaged. At no point was I provided with an inventory list
during my tenancy, and I cannot recall any specific items being
damaged or removed. Without an inventory list or photos to reference,
this claim is entirely speculative, and I have no way to assess the
accuracy of the allegation. As such, I dispute this claim.
8. Tenant Personal Property Left in the House, Garage, Tiki Hut, and
Front and Rear Yards
Response:
While I made several documented attempts to retrieve my personal
property, many of which went ignored (see Addendum C), I cannot recall
leaving significant items behind that would have necessitated
disposal.
However, your Notice does not provide any details on what personal
property was left or the cost of removal, making it impossible for me
to confirm the validity of this claim. Without documentation, I
dispute this charge.
9. Unauthorized Cutting by Tenant of the Legacy Jackfruit Tree in the
Rear Yard
Response:
I recall pruning the jackfruit tree for safety reasons, as it was
overgrown and posed a risk to the yard. This action was in line with
the maintenance responsibilities I took on after prior maintenance
requests to the landlord were unmet and unresponded to such as a
kitchen sink in, or around October 2023, that you failed to act on
resulting on me, the tenant, taking on the responsibility to make the
kitchen sink usable again. This is in addition to your mention of
installing a new fence gate to prevent furthter intruders from easily
entering the backyard, and subsequently our home, which did occur on
March 26th, 2024. You responded by verbally agreeing to a new fence,
that the existing fence gate was deteriated, and used verbiage of
"metal fence door with lock" that we relied on. No action was taken
after the attempted burgurly on the fence gate which remained loose,
accessible, and dangerous. For these reasons, I tended to the safety
issue of hanging branches over heavily used areas in the backyard, and
branches encroaching on powerlines leading the house.
I've included a copy of the police report from the March 26th, 2024
incident I alluded to.
You claim that this could cause the tree to become diseased, but you
have provided no expert assessment or evidence to support this claim.
Pruning a tree for safety reasons is reasonable under Florida law, and
without specific documentation or photos showing damage, I dispute
this claim.
10. Tenant Stayed in the Premises Several Days Beyond the Lease
Expiration Date
Response:
I vacated the premises on September 2nd, 2024. I provided detail to
your proxy that movers had canceled the day of due to the large storm
that arrived. In addition, I provided details of our next location of
stay being cancelled the day of, also due to storm, the same storm
that delayed garbage collection from the City of Gulfport, FL.
Further, I outlined mental health issues this caused and the
subsequent panic attack I endured.

Your claim that I stayed beyond the lease term is accurage, but to
point to any dollar amount associated to this line item does not
exist, and if it did, is unsubstantiated.
I dispute this charge in full.
11. Caused the Landlord to Be Unable to Show or Relet the Premises Due
to Extended Occupancy and Unclean Condition
Response:
There is no documentation supporting your claim that the property was
“unclean” or that I caused a delay in reletting, so I dispute this
claim in full.
12. Extensive Cleaning Will Be Required to Restore the Premises to the
Condition It Was In at Move-In
Response:
Your statement that “extensive cleaning will be required” is
speculative and vague. Based on my recollection, the property was left
in clean condition, and any minor cleaning required is part of the
normal turnover process between tenants. Given that the property was
relisted almost immediately, any extensive cleaning claims seem
unwarranted. I dispute this claim as speculative and unsupported by
any documentation, such as cleaning invoices or before-and-after
photos.
I am willing to take responsibility for minor, admitted issues, only
on the basis that photographic evidence showing before and after
evidence, is provided
However, the vast majority of your claims are too vague, unsupported
by evidence, or speculative in nature. Without the necessary specifics
or documentation, I cannot adequately evaluate or agree with your
claims, and therefore, I formally dispute the majority of the
deductions.Furhter, they point to an inventory list that was never
provide, formerly or informerly, nor was it included in the mutally
signed lease agreement.
If necessary, I am prepared to pursue this matter further, as Florida
law requires landlords to provide specific and supported claims when
withholding a tenant’s security deposit.
If necessary, I am prepared to pursue this matter further, as Florida
law requires landlords to provide specific and supported claims when

Unauthorized Use and Conversion of Personal Property
As of mid-October 2024, I am aware that my personal belongings,
specifically including my Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill and other
items, remain on the property. Despite multiple documented requests to
retrieve these items, which were ignored (see Addendum C), the
property is now being marketed with amenities that include
“barbequing” in the backyard.
I have attached screenshots (see Addendum D) of the current rental
listing, which explicitly mentions “barbequing” as an amenity.
Notably, this was not advertised in the rental listing when I
originally leased the property last year, indicating that my personal
grill is being used to promote the property to new tenants.
This constitutes unauthorized use and conversion of my personal
property under Florida law. Conversion occurs when someone unlawfully
exercises control over another person’s property in a manner
inconsistent with the owner’s rights. Your failure to allow me to
retrieve my property and the ongoing marketing of that property
without my consent makes you liable for conversion.
IV. Invalidity of Claims Due to Lack of Inventory List
Your Notice references "missing and damaged artwork, furnishings, and
housewares inventory list items." However, this claim is invalid and
unenforceable for the following reasons:
No Specific Inventory List Provided:
Upon careful review of the lease agreement, I found no specific
inventory list of the landlord's personal property (such as
furnishings, artwork, or housewares) provided within the document.
While the lease does refer to "all furnishings and personal property"
as being included with the property, it does not itemize what those
furnishings or personal property items are.
Absence of Separate Inventory Documentation:
At no point during my tenancy was I provided with a separate inventory
list detailing the specific items of furniture, artwork, or housewares
that were considered part of the rental property.
Lack of Baseline for Comparison:
Without an initial, itemized inventory, it is impossible to
substantiate claims of missing or damaged items. There is no baseline
against which to compare the condition of the property at the end of
the tenancy.
Without an initial, itemized inventory, it is impossible to
substantiate claims of missing or damaged items. There is no baseline
against which to compare the condition of the property at the end of
the tenancy.
Unreasonable Accountability:
Holding tenants accountable for items that were never clearly defined
or documented at the start of my tenancy is unreasonable and
potentially unlawful.
Burden of Proof:
The burden of proving the existence, condition, and value of any item
claimed to be damaged or missing lies with you, the landlord. Without
a detailed inventory list, you cannot meet this burden of proof.
Legal Precedent:In Johnson v. Baker, 388 So.2d 1056 (Fla. 4th DCA
1980), the court held that without an inventory or evidence of the
property's condition at the beginning of the tenancy, a landlord
cannot prove that a tenant caused damages. This principle extends to
claims of missing items as well.
Furthermore, in Durene v. Alcime, 448 So.2d 1208 (Fla. 3d DCA 1984),
the court emphasized the importance of proper documentation in
landlord-tenant disputes. The absence of a detailed inventory list
significantly weakens any claim related to personal property items.
C. Request for Disclosure of Security Deposit Details:
Pursuant to Florida Statute §83.49(2), and as included in the signed
lease agreement on page 10 of 20, which requires landlords who own or
manage five or more rental units to disclose the location and status
of the security deposit within 30 days of receiving it, which was not
provided to me, the tenant, I hereby request that you confirm:
- The number of rental units you own or manage in the state of
Florida.
- Whether my security deposit was placed in a separate bank account,
and if so, whether the account is interest-bearing or non-interest-
bearing.
This information is crucial to ensuring full compliance with Florida
law and transparency in our landlord-tenant relationship.
D. Pattern of Landlord Negligence and Tenant's Reasonable Actions
It is crucial to note that your failure to address maintenance issues
began early in the tenancy and established a pattern of negligence
that influenced my subsequent actions regarding property maintenance.
As detailed in Addendum A, which provides a comprehensive timeline of
maintenance requests and actions taken during the tenancy:
It is crucial to note that your failure to address maintenance issues
began early in the tenancy and established a pattern of negligence
that influenced my subsequent actions regarding property maintenance.
As detailed in Addendum A, which provides a comprehensive timeline of
maintenance requests and actions taken during the tenancy:
Initial Maintenance Request Ignored:
On or about October 2023, at the early onset of the lease, I
encountered a severely clogged kitchen sink drain, rendering
the left portion of the two-bucket sink unusable. I promptly
submitted a maintenance request regarding this issue.
Tenant's Reasonable Response:
Given the urgency of the problem and your lack of response, I was
forced to address the issue myself. Using my basic knowledge of
clogged plumbing systems and a $15 liquid solution, I successfully
unclogged the drain and restored functionality to the sink.
Established Pattern of Landlord Negligence & Justification for
Tenant's Actions:
This early instance of neglect set a precedent for how I had to handle
future maintenance issues. Your demonstrated unwillingness to comply
with your legal obligations to maintain the premises under Florida
Statute §83.51 led me to take on necessary maintenance tasks to ensure
the habitability of the property.
Extreme Reasoning for Tenant's Resonable Response:
In addition, the previously mentioned break-in on March 26th, 2024
provided extermemly valid concern for tenant safety. You mentioned
action you would take, but did not. Further, as seen in the text
message documentation, I proposed acting independent of you, propsing
the installation of Ring Security cameras.
Your response, as shown, was to allow it, but on the condition of "no
screwing." This was a rediculous response to one of my two inquiring.
The second inquiry was around our safety and the need for better fence
gates. That went ignored in your response. You only addressed the
request for security cameras, similar cameras that seemingly every
neighbor on Tifton ST. South has - for good reason.
This pattern of negligence, unresponsiveness, over committing to
actions that were never performed provide solid ground as to why
taking our own safety measure, including maintenance only related to
potential power outages due to unattended, sagging branches was an
action performed with just cause, by the tenant, Stephen Boerner, as
outlined herein. I understood that our safety and maintenance needs
were a low priority based on actions observed which lowered any
reasonable expectations for future support.

outlined herein. I understood that our safety and maintenance needs
were a low priority based on actions observed which lowered any
reasonable expectations for future support.
Timeline of Events:
Please refer to Addendum C for a detailed timeline (documented in text
messages between Luther Rollins and Stephen Boerner, of maintenance
requests, follow-ups, and actions taken throughout the tenancy. Due to
Apple overwriting text messages prior to the start of 2024, the sink
incident is not documented, but a subpoena would support this claim.
This timeline is supported by email correspondence, text messages, and
receipts, all of which are included in Addendum C.
This pattern of negligence not only violates Florida Statute §83.51
but also demonstrates a breach of the implied warranty of
habitability. It provides context for my actions throughout the
tenancy and should be considered when evaluating any claims against
the security deposit.
V. Violation of Florida Statute §715.104 Regarding Personal Property
A. Unlawful Retention and Disposal of Personal Property
Your actions regarding my personal property left on the premises are
in direct violation of Florida Statute §715.104(1), which states:
"After taking possession of the premises... the landlord shall give
written notice to the former tenant... stating that the property is
considered abandoned and that the landlord intends to dispose of it if
not claimed."
You have failed to comply with this statute in the following ways:
You did not provide the required written notice regarding abandoned
property.
You failed to respond to my multiple written requests, dated September
25, 2024, and September 27, 2024, for access to retrieve my personal
property.
Your failure to provide the required notice and your lack of response
to my documented attempts to retrieve my property constitute a clear
violation of the statute.
B. Unauthorized Use and Conversion of Personal Property
Your new rental listing advertises amenities that include my personal
property, specifically my Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill. This
constitutes unauthorized use and conversion of my property.
Your new rental listing advertises amenities that include my personal
property, specifically my Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill. This
constitutes unauthorized use and conversion of my property.
Legal Precedent:
In Goodwin v. Alexatos, 584 So.2d 1007 (Fla. 5th DCA 1991), the court
held that unauthorized retention and use of another's property
constitutes conversion, entitling the owner to recover the property's
value and potentially punitive damages.
C. Liability for Damages
Under Florida Statute §715.109:
"A landlord who does not comply with this part shall be liable to the
former tenant for actual damages or three months' rent, whichever is
greater, and costs of the action."
Given that my monthly rent was $4,500.00, you could be liable for
$13,500.00 plus costs the action and costs if this matter proceeds to
litigation.
VI. Proposed Options for Resolution
In an effort to resolve this matter amicably, I propose the following
options:
VIII. Proposed Options for Resolution
In an effort to resolve this matter amicably, I propose the following
options:
Option 1: Immediate Settlement
• Payment to Me:
• Full Value of Personal Property: $4,210.62
• Half of Security Deposit: $2,250.00
• Total Payment: $6,460.62
• No Further Action: Upon receipt of this payment, I
will consider the matter fully resolved and will not pursue additional
legal action regarding this issue.
This option allows for a swift and mutually beneficial resolution with
minimal effort on your part.
Option 2: Full Compliance and Reconciliation
• Burden of Proof: You provide a comprehensive, itemized
list substantiating all your claims and allegations, including:
• Detailed Itemization: Specific damages and associated
costs.
• Supporting Documentation: Receipts, invoices,
photographs, and any relevant evidence.
• Inventory List: A complete inventory of items
allegedly missing or damaged.
• Adjust Claims Accordingly: We reconcile any
discrepancies based on the provided evidence. You return any
unsubstantiated portion of the security deposit and address the issue
of my personal property.
• Legal Compliance: Ensure full adherence to Florida
statutes in all communications and actions to avoid litigation.
This option requires significant effort on your part to meet the full
burden of proof as mandated by law.
Option 3: Legal Action
• No Response or Inadequate Resolution: If you do not
respond appropriately within the 15-day period, I will proceed with
legal action.
• Claims Sought in Litigation:
• Full Security Deposit: $4,500.00
• Value of Personal Property: $4,210.62
• Total Amount Sought: $8,710.62
• Additional Remedies:
• Statutory Damages: Potentially exceeding $13,500.00
under Florida Statutes §§83.49 and 715.104.
• Attorney’s Fees and Court Costs
• Punitive Damages: For willful and malicious conduct.
I am prepared to file a claim at the county level, outside of small
claims court, to pursue the full extent of damages allowable under the
law.
This option provides a structured environment for resolving our
differences without resorting to litigation.
VII. Conclusion and Next Steps
Given the seriousness of the violations outlined in this letter and
the potential legal consequences, I strongly urge you to carefully
consider the proposed options for resolution. Your failure to comply
with Florida law regarding security deposits and personal property
puts you at risk of significant financial penalties and legal action.
I request that you respond to this letter within 15 days of receipt,
indicating your preferred option for resolution. If I do not receive a
satisfactory response within this timeframe, I will have no choice but
to pursue legal remedies, including but not limited to:
1. Filing a complaint with the Florida Department of Business and
Professional Regulation.
2. Initiating a small claims court action for the return of my
security deposit and the value of my personal property.
3. Seeking treble damages as allowed under Florida Statute §83.49(3)
(c).
4. Pursuing additional damages for conversion of personal property.
I sincerely hope we can resolve this matter amicably and avoid the
need for legal action. However, I am prepared to vigorously defend my
rights as a tenant under Florida law if necessary.
Please direct all future communication regarding this matter to me in
writing at the address provided at the beginning of this letter.
Sincerely,
Stephen Boerner

Addendum A: Timeline of Maintenance Requests and Actions
On or about October 23, the left side of a kitchen sink was clogged
severely rendering it useless Stephen Boerner the tenant reached out
to Luther Rollins via text but multiple days went by without
resolution. Ultimately, the tenant ceased request located the required
solution for a price of $15 later finding similar solution on the home
premises mixed with many other cleaning supplies where in the landlord
could have provided information as to location of this cleaning supply
to avoid unnecessary expense on the tenants behalf. It took a week of
multiple usages to render the sink unclogged where an appropriate
action would have been a local plumber to expedite the issue right
away.
On March 26, 2024, the residence located at 2649 Tifton St. S. in
Gulfport, FL 33711 was trespassed by an individual who entered from
the rear entry by easily opening and stepping through the decayed and
ineffective left side gate intended to prevent outside entry. The
perpetrator then proceeded to enter the home office, causing damage to
the office desk and attempting to steal electronics. The whereabouts
of the perpetrator were revealed when they stood at the doorway of
Melissa Bemer, the wife of Stephen Boerner. At that moment, the
tenants' dog vocally frightened the perpetrator, who then tried to
leave through the back door but was confronted by tenant Stephen
Boerner, rendering the perpetrator immobile.
On March 26, 2024 Stephen Boerner contacted Luther Rollins they
engaged in a conversation where Luther spoke to his known awareness of
the decaying side gates and mentioned that metal would probably be the
best option Stephen Boerner the tenant was left thinking this solution
and whether metal or just a solid door to replace a decay door was
emotion that would take place and it was mentioned in a follow-up text
message shown in the appropriate addendum here in where it was ignored

Hi Luther, yes, and I will be there for the game Monday. I'll
represent Philly with class, but not TOO much class! ;-)
Also, i wanted to get your advice on the kitchen sink.
It's gradually gotten worse with ongoing clogging on the left side.
I've tried multiple de-clogging products. Some worked but only rarely.
Now, nothing really works.
Any little bit of water will sit and drain only after about 24 hours
so we can only effectively use the right side of the sink to avoid
water building up on the left.

I'd be happy to run with any handy requirements within the bounds of
basic handyman quick fix skills that you may be aware of, but,
respectfully, I wouldn't want to tinker with anything more than basic
de-cloggers fluids when dealing with plumbing, pipes, etc that don't
belong to me.
Open to any insights and advice. Thank you. Everything else is

Hi,

Hope you all had a great weekend! Received the rent check on time.
Hi Luther, we had a break-in last night. We are okay and the man was
arrested at 3:30am just this morning. The police were on site, report
filed, and charges pressed. Initially, it was "trespassing" per the
police but I just found evidence he had intent to steal. So I am
calling to alter the charges to include Burglary. Anc we just now
discovered minor damage to one piece of furniture in the house.
Easier to talk it all through but l'd like to document this with you
so you are fully aware
Absolutely. Document with the police and take photos. Glad you are
okay and the perpetrator was caught. Please call me today when you are
available. We've never had any activity like this in the past.

We'd also feel safer with metal, lockable gates.
Luther, sharing this rap sheet of the man who entered our home. It's
terrifying to press charges even though I told the officer "yes" to
charges pressed for trespassing. I don't know if that created a charge
or if I have actions to take to do so.
I spoke to an attorney here. After digging in, he advised me to back
off, considering he has no assets and acts with violence often. He
said I was likely to create risk by going after him, which I didn't
like hearing.
The adrenaline has worn off, and we both realize how dangerous the
other night was and how lucky we were.
Now, knowing what I know about his background, I'm worried about us
living here. I think it will dissipate in time, but I need to decide
what to do vs what not to
Either way, l'd like to get cameras to alert us with motion detectors,
and I can buy those if you agree. They will be attachable to the
exterior but not cameras requiring drilling. Ring cameras have worked
for me before.
As of now, they don't lock, and he knows that.
He got a DUl the same night (the police told me), but today, his car
is gone fron his driveway, so he is driving—no regard for much
And I'm skeptical the DUl was even given as the DUl as the cops seemed
to know and like him. His mindset is vengeful, and no one can tell me
we aren't on his hit list for pressing trespassing charges. The
attorney also said I couldn't prove he intended to steal anything, so
burglary charges won't hold

The perpetrator sounds like a bad person and repeat petty criminal. I
hear you and agree it might be best to not press charges. And
hopefully never see this guy again. The city and society don't really
have a good answer re what punishment for people like that. No respect
for others and no interest in rehab I'm okay with you getting motion
detector cameras as long as no drilling. Other renters have installed
them up here. Also maybe put a plastic sign in the yard that says
video surveillance. Might be a deterrent too.
Let's hope in the end this is an isolated and 1-time only event. I
plan to come down in April and check things.

Hi Luther, could we please schedule for Monday and I can meet
somewhere for coffee or meet at the house. We have plenty of wine and
coffee at the house
We can not do Sunday we have company here that leaves after a dinner
Sunday eve. we are hosting currently
But Monday is wide open. Feel free to pick the best time for you.
Sounds good.
I will probably want to briefly check out the front & back yards on
Sunday re maintenance.
Ok what time will that be? Can let me know later no rush

in about an hour or closer to 1pm then gone until 5-6pm. My wife may
return prior to that but will be inside, if so. You'll see we are
having a dinner outback but nothing that will be in your way. Feel
free to take care of things outside and I'll be around tomorrow for

Luther, who is GeoForce and are they approved to come on property?
They are digging a hole
My research shows they are allowed due to "utility easement" but I had
no heads up and glad I didn't take it too far just a little on edge.
They just left
Thanks for the info. Yes the area behind shed and where the utility
pole is located is a utility easement, but did they knock or let you
know they were going on the property and were going to dig a hole? The
backyard is not their easement, so as a courtesy they should let you
know they want to go in and
access the utility pole area.
Pls keep me posted. Thx!! d
Sorry at work couldn't pick up no need to talk. I didn't hear the
knock but Lucy barked once I'm just realizing that was probably their
knock. I can't 100 percent say they did not knock I just heard them
coming through the gates as it is next to the bedroom and was early
this am. They were there for 15 minutes in total. After my text to you
I saw them at each house on Tifton so seems more okay now.
Keeping you in loop seems fine tho
Good letting me know and no problem. Mostly we don't want them to
overstep their bounds or leave waste or cause any damage while
allegedly making repairs or upgrades. ©

Luther, hope all is well. When we met at the house here, I mentioned
the backyard flood / motion light blinking. It's the reason we keep
the light switch inside set to off for the outdoor lights. Naturally,
it wasn't doing this when you were here. No rhyme or reason. You'll
see it goes completely on when it picked up my motion (I presume) but
then I went inside then back out again, and it stayed off. Just wanted
to share what I was speaking to when we met here

Hi Luther, l'd like to talk about our upcoming lease renewal. We
discussed it briefly. Perhaps we can set up a time. We have interest
in a couple options you might consider. One option would be to add two
months extension. Our lease is 10 months and concludes August 31st so
perhaps we could extend it two months to make it 12 months total. Or,
we could renew September 1st and renew for an additional 12 months.
Just planting the seed here. Open to talk when you are
Certainly.
Will in the next few days discuss renewal options with my wife and get
back to you. ©d
Hi Steve,
Had to go up to Boston to see my daughter who had a difficult
pregnancy. So out of pocket for a few days. But will definitely talk
with you soon about lease renewal and/or extension options. ©d
Regards, Luther
Zero rush. Starting the conversation earlier than needed. Please, zero
rush or need on our end. We wish all the best.
Received June rent chk. on time. Thanks!
Will talk to you soon about lease extension and renewal ®
Hi Luther, i made a clerical error in managing the account our rent
checks pull from. The last check appears to have not processed. Did
you experience that as well? If so, i believe that voids the written
check. I will promptly send another if that is the case. In the same
envelop i will also provide a second check for $4,500 for the month of
July 2024. And we paid August's rent in the down payment at time of
lease signing as August is the last month of our lease.
Please respond as soon as possible regarding the June rent payment. I
can also fedex a flat-rate envelope for June and July rent checks to
expedite this. Thank you

Hi luther, spoke to melissa. $4,500/month is higher than we would
prefer coming into this phase in life.
She brought up good points i agree with and found an alternative im
seeing shortly. Let's call it "nesting." This is where i follow her
lead and put my preferences on the back burner. Mamma instinct kickin
in which is a beautiful thing to see.
That said, one option she was open to was a 1 or two month extension
without the commitment to extend. But the price would need to be less.
I respect, and understand, you and your wife's stance in terms of
pricing such a perfect home. For the sake of collecting answers for
Melissa, are you open to a decreased monthly cost for 1 or 2 months.
If yes,l can take that to Melissa and have an answer no later than
Wednesday morning so we can agree or not agree on extending. Not
extending at lower monthly for 1-2 months would mean we would move on
and say goodbye/thank you and pursue ensuring our security deposit by
leaving the home in good standing as it exists today.
Hi Steve,
Good info and update. I will discuss with my wife shortly and get back
to you.
Please keep in mind that the $4500 was a flat rent and we paid all
utilities electric, internet etc. So, not too high for a 2/2 house w/
yard. Did you overnigh the June rent check? This is now 10 days past
due.
Thanks!
Luther,
Thank yoy.
Please compensate yourself for our late June payment. I can either
send a late fee via check or you can deduct the late fee from the
security deposit. Or, however you would prefer. Its not right to be
this late and its my responsibility. No favors please.

The June and July checks were sent via USPS. I asked they be FedEx
overnighted but she didnt have time to go inside a fedex and my golf
cart is urrently out of commission. Doesnt matter the reasons just
know that both Jun and July rent checks are in the mail. Both checks
are dated June 10th 2024 s you can deposit July early. Our accounts
are restored with more than enough to
Again, i apologize for this. I understand the frustration and any
concern. With the June and July check en route to you, once processed,
we are all paid up through August 31st as August was paid as part of
the first/last/security deposit paid upfront at lease signing.
As of now, we will plan to be out of the house by August 31st as i
dont blame you for not wanting to offer discounted months after August
31st when the 10-month lease concludes.
Hi Stephen,
Thanks for the update. Hope you get the golf cart up and going. Would
a discounted one month (Sept.) extender be useful for you & Melissa?
Otherwise, we will proceed to end in August as stated in the lease.
Thanks!

Thank you for offering. Very generous. What would the discounted price
be for september?
I'm sure my wife would agree to a rate of $125×30 for September. So,
it would be total $3,750
Ok will talk to melissa tonight she works untill 11pm thank you
Good morning,
Thanks again.
Here is my personal email:
Stephen.Boerner@gmail.com
We would like to take you up on the kind offer to extend the original
10-month lease to a single month, the 11th month, and our final month
at $3,750 from September 1st-September 31st 2024 at which time we will
not be renewing further. Also, thank you for the kindness and support
as we will pay that forward to others, especially renters of ours.
Feel free to share the extension paperwork to my personal email and i
will expedite. If youd like payment front, i am happy to send a check
sooner than later to ensure we all feel good about it.
Good morning!
I will send you a short written extension letter for you to sign.
Please sign and return promptly.
Thanks!

Hi Luther, we had a break-in last night. We are okay and the man was
arrested at 3:30am just this morning. The police were on site, report
filed, and charges pressed. Initially, it was "trespassing" per the
police but I just found evidence he had intent to steal. So I am
calling to alter the charges to include Burglary. And we just now
discovered minor damage to one piece of furniture in the house. Easier
to talk it all through but l'd like to document this with you so you
are fully aware

Absolutely. Document with the police and take photos. Glad you are
okay and the perpetrator was caught. Please call me today when you are
available. We've never had any activity like this in the past.

Luther, sharing this rap sheet of the man who entered our home. It's
terrifying to press charges even though I told the officer "yes" to
charges pressed for trespassing. I don't know if that created a charge
or if I have actions to take to do so.
I spoke to an attorney here. After digging in, he advised me to back
off, considering he has no assets and acts with violence often. He
said I was likely to create risk by going after him, which I didn't
like hearing.
The adrenaline has worn off, and we both realize how dangerous the
other night was and how lucky we were.
Now, knowing what I know about his background, I'm worried about us
living here. I think it will dissipate in time, but I need to decide
what to do vs what not to do.
Either way, l'd like to get cameras to alert us with motion detectors,
and I can buy those if you agree. They will be attachable to the
exterior but not cameras requiring drilling. Ring cameras have worked
for me before.
We'd also feel safer with metal, lockable gates.
As of now, they don't lock, and he knows that.
He got a DUl the same night (the police told me), but today, his car
is gone from his driveway, so he is driving-no regard for much.
And I'm skeptical the DUl was even given as the DUl as the cops seemed
to know and like him. His mindset is vengeful, and no one can tell me
we aren't on his hit list for pressing trespassing charges. The
attorney also said I couldn't prove he intended to steal anything, sc
burglary charges won't hold
3/28/24 9:29:48 PM EDT
Luther Rollins (+13142697670)
The perpetrator sounds like a bad person and repeat petty criminal. I
hear you and agree it might be best to not press charges. And
hopefully never see this guy again. The city and society don't really
have a good answer re what punishment for people like that. No respect
for others and no interest in rehab
I'm okay with you getting motion detector cameras as long as no
drilling.
Other renters have installed them up here. Also maybe put a plastic
sign in the yard that says video surveillance. Might be a deterrent
too.
Let's hope in the end this is an isolated and 1-time only event. I
plan to come down in April and check things.

Hi Luther, in motion at the moment and just wanted to reply to the

the house in about an hour or closer to 1pm then gone until 5-6pm. My
wife may return prior to that but will be inside, if so. You'll see we
are having a dinner outback but nothing that will be in your way. Feel
free to take care of things outside and I'll be around tomorrow for
inside the house and helping with whatever you need there

Luther, who is GeoForce and are they approved to come on property?
They are digging a hole
4/24/24 9:22:00 AM EDT
My research shows they are allowed due to "utility easement" but I had
no heads up and glad I didn't take it too far just a little on edge.
They just left
4/24/24 4:32:28 PM EDT
Luther Rollins (+13142697670)
Thanks for the info. Yes the area behind shed and where the utility
pole is located is a utility easement, but did they knock or let you
know they were going on the property and were going to dig a hole? The
backyard is not their easement, so as a courtesy they should let you
know they want to go in and access the utility pole area.
Pis keep me posted. Thx!! d
4/24/24 4:34:48 PM EDT
Sorry at work couldn't pick up no need to talk. I didn't hear the
knock but Lucy barked once I'm just realizing that was probably their
knock. I can't 100 percent say they did not knock I just heard them
coming through the gates as it is next to the bedroom and was early
this am. They were there for 15 minutes in total. After my text to you
I saw them at each house on Tifton so seems more okay now. Keeping you
in loop seems fine tho
4/24/24 4:40:37 PM EDT
Luther Rollins (+13142697670)
Good letting me know and no problem. Mostly we don't want them to
overstep their bounds or leave waste or cause any damage while
allegedly making repairs or upgrades. ©
4/26/24 8:56:08 PM EDT
Luther, hope all is well. When we met at the house here, I mentioned
the backyard flood / motion light blinking. It's the reason we keep
the light switch inside set to off for the outdoor lights. Naturally,
it wasn't doing this when you were here. No rhyme or reason. You'll
see it goes completely on when it picked up my motion (I presume) but
then I went inside then back out again, and it stayed off. Just wanted
to share what I was speaking to when we met here

Luther, such is life to be this unpredictable. But the path forward
for our
nesting period
Has shifted with new information.
I speak from both Melissa and I when I say thank you for a wonderful
stay and being a great landlord
our need to extend into a single, discounted month has shifted and to
declining that option as a result of new life information on our end
in which I will spare you the detail but all is positive.
That said we are opting to not sign the one month extension and I
thank you for expediting it.
60 days from today is August 31, 2024 which marks the last day of our
lease that is currently in agreement.

during our last walk-through when Zach was at the house he told me he
cannot make it and will be out of town August 30 so he left a lockbox
attached to the front door handle and gave me the code so I could put
my keys in the lock box on my way out. I told him I would notify him
when I walked out of the house for the last time and my keys were
secured in the lock box attached to the front door. I plan to be out
of the house by 6 PM or 7 PM at the latest on Saturday, August 31st

If need be, you and I can speak on August 31st's move-out day - or
prior to that - just to align on specifics as I'm leaving them. We
really want to feel good about turning the house over in equal/better
condition than we found it outside of the few items shared with Zach
such as minor storm damage and such. Also, Zach I'm sure mentioned to
you the AC needing repair. Zach said he knew of an HVAC repair company
to assist, but I haven't heard of any next steps there. It should be
addressed this week as you don't want the issue sitting with no one
there to monitor it

Got your voicemail. I have a small window at 6:15-6:30pm today is a
busy one for me. I will call you then. If you're not able to pick up,
I will leave you a voicemail with the details.
8/26/24 4:29:20 PM EDT
And tomorrow, l'm much more flexible and available anytime for the
most part
8/26/24 5:44:07 PM EDT
I can't pick up but I read your voicemail. I will not be home this
evening, but if you need to act fact on scheduling hvac, I can make
myself available tomorrow at anytime as I am working from home
tomorrow and Wednesday so anytime you want to schedule the hvac guy to
come by, you can move forward without checking with me. Zach does not
have to be there as I will be home tomorrow (Tuesday) and Wednesday
all day both days. Does this give you the information you need right
now in this moment or do you need me to call you at 6:15pm - 6:30pm as
I mentioned that is my only window to speak this evening

I just left you a voicemail. I ran home to meet hvac repair guy. I'm
here with him now and he's working on the AC. I will touch base with
you when I have more information from him, but the good news is is
that I am home and he's here working on it.

HVAC repair guy is returning Wednesday to complete the fix. He epaired
it enough for now there is no leak and appears to be an eas solution.
I aligned with the hvac repair guy in terms of him having my ce number
to notify me directly as to what day and time he will be returning to
the house. He will let you know as well as me so I have a heads up for

All is well and thank for the kind words and always being a fantastic
person to rent from.
Melissa left some baked goods for me to pass around to those in
Gulfport who were dear friends, helped us get settled, helped in times
of difficulty, etc.
Will you be stopping by any time today? or perhaps tomorrow or Monday?
If so, I will leave them here for you as well as Zach. If not, 1 won't
let them spoil and no problem at all. Wrapped up, it could last a week
or so in the fridge here at the house as well
Anyway, baked goods aside, I have a crew arriving late this afternoon
to haul the boxes and that will be that.

Address for refund of security deposit:

Don't think my schedule will allow me to stop by. And I think Zach is
away until Tuesday. So best to give the baked goods to others. I will
do a close-out inspection and if things are okay then I will use the
forwarding address to send your refund. Thanks! dO

Thank you, Luther.
Hi Luther, I'm leaving town tonight indefinitely. It's the only
opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your
properly. I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank
you

Hi Stephen,
I called you a couple times today to discuss the Tenant Response &
Dispute you sent to me which I recently received. I hope we could talk
(and I believe we are both supposed to) try to resolve amicably. I am
available most days this week 9:00am-ish till about 10pm.
Thanks! Luther
