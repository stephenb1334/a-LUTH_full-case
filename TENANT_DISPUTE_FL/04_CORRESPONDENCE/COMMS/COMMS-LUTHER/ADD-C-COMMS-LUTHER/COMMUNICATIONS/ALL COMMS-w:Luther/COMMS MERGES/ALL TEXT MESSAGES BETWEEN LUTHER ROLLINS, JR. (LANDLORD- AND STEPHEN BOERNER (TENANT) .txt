Luther,
The rent check was mailed yesterday and made it in time to head your way as of yesterday’s standard mail delivery.
Now that we have the envelopes and know the system you prefer, timing won’t be an issue. Wanted you to know to keep an eye out for it.
That is our “month 2” rental payment. After delivery, we will have paid months 1, 2, and 10 of 10 total months by our records.

Hi Luther, yes, and I will be there for the game Monday. I’ll represent Philly with class, but not TOO much class! ;-)
Go birds!
Also, i wanted to get your advice on the kitchen sink.
It’s gradually gotten worse with ongoing clogging on the left side.
I’ve tried multiple de-clogging products. Some worked but only rarely. Now, nothing really works.
Any little bit of water will sit and drain only after about 24 hours so we can only effectively use the right side of the sink to avoid water building up on the left.
I’d be happy to run with any handy requirements within the bounds of basic handyman quick fix skills that you may be aware of, but, respectfully, I wouldn’t want to tinker with anything more than basic de-cloggers fluids when dealing with plumbing, pipes, etc that don’t belong to me.
Open to any insights and advice. Thank you. Everything else is perfect. Loving it

Hi Luther, we had a break-in last night. We are okay and the man was arrested at 3:30am just this morning. The police were on site, report filed, and charges pressed. Initially, it was “trespassing” per the police but I just found evidence he had intent to steal. So I am calling to alter the charges to include Burglary. And we just now discovered minor damage to one piece of furniture in the house. Easier to talk it all through but I’d like to document this with you so you are fully aware

From: Luther J. Rollins, Jr.
To: Stephen J. Boerner
Text Detail: 03-26-2024 / 15:23:22
Absolutely. Document with the police and take photos. Glad you are okay and the perpetrator was caught. Please call me today when you are available. We’ve never had any activity like this in the past.

Luther, sharing this rap sheet of the man who entered our home. It’s terrifying to press charges even though I told the officer “yes” to charges pressed for trespassing. I don’t know if that created a charge or if I have actions to take to do so.
I spoke to an attorney here. After digging in, he advised me to back off, considering he has no assets and acts with violence often. He said I was likely to create risk by going after him, which I didn’t like hearing.
The adrenaline has worn off, and we both realize how dangerous the other night was and how lucky we were.
Now, knowing what I know about his background, I’m worried about us living here. I think it will dissipate in time, but I need to decide what to do vs what not to do.
Either way, I’d like to get cameras to alert us with motion detectors, and I can buy those if you agree. They will be attachable to the exterior but not cameras requiring drilling. Ring cameras have worked for me before.
We’d also feel safer with metal, lockable gates.
As of now, they don’t lock, and he knows that.
He got a DUI the same night (the police told me), but today, his car is gone from his driveway, so he is driving—no regard for much.
And I’m skeptical the DUI was even given as the cops seemed to know and like him. His mindset is vengeful, and no one can tell me we aren’t on his hit list for pressing trespassing charges. The attorney also said I couldn’t prove he intended to steal anything, so burglary charges won’t hold.

From: Luther J. Rollins, Jr.
To: Stephen J. Boerner
Text Detail: 03-28-2024 / 21:29:48
The perpetrator sounds like a bad person and repeat petty criminal. I hear you and agree it might be best to not press charges. And hopefully never see this guy again. The city and society don’t really have a good answer re what punishment for people like that. No respect for others and no interest in rehab
I’m okay with you getting motion detector cameras as long as no drilling. Other renters have installed them up here. Also maybe put a plastic sign in the yard that says video surveillance. Might be a deterrent too.
Let’s hope in the end this is an isolated and 1-time only event. I plan to come down in April and check things.

From: Stephen J. Boerner
To: Luther J. Rollins, Jr.
Text Detail: 04-24-2024 / 09:22:00
My research shows they are allowed due to “utility easement” but I had no heads up and glad I didn’t take it too far just a little on edge . They just left

From: Luther J. Rollins, Jr.
To: Stephen J. Boerner
Text Detail: 04-24-2024 / 16:32:28
Thanks for the info. Yes the area behind shed and where the utility pole is located is a utility easement, but did they knock or let you know they were going on the property and were going to dig a hole? The backyard is not their easement, so as a courtesy they should let you know they want to go in and access the utility pole area.
Pls keep me posted. Thx!!👍🏽

From: Stephen J. Boerner
To: Luther J. Rollins, Jr.
Text Detail: 04-24-2024 / 16:34:48
Sorry at work couldn’t pick up no need to talk. I didn’t hear the knock but Lucy barked once I’m just realizing that was probably their knock. I can’t 100 percent say they did not knock I just heard them coming through the gates as it is next to the bedroom and was early this am. They were there for 15 minutes in total. After my text to you I saw them at each house on Tifton so seems more okay now. Keeping you in loop seems fine tho

Luther, hope all is well. When we met at the house here, I mentioned the backyard flood / motion light blinking. It’s the reason we keep the light switch inside set to off for the outdoor lights. Naturally, it wasn’t doing this when you were here. No rhyme or reason. You’ll see it goes completely on when it picked up my motion (I presume) but then I went inside then back out again, and it stayed off. Just wanted to share what I was speaking to when we met here

Hi Luther, I’d like to talk about our upcoming lease renewal. We discussed it briefly. Perhaps we can set up a time. We have interest in a couple options you might consider. One option would be to add two months extension. Our lease is 10 months and concludes August 31st so perhaps we could extend it two months to make it 12 months total. Or, we could renew September 1st and renew for an additional 12 months. Just planting the seed here. Open to talk when you are

From: Luther J. Rollins, Jr.
To: Stephen J. Boerner

Hi Luther, i made a clerical error in managing the account our rent checks pull from. The last check appears to have not processed. Did you experience that as well? If so, i believe that voids the written check. I will promptly send another if that is the case. In the same envelop i will also provide a second check for $4,500 for the month of July 2024. And we paid August’s rent in the down payment at time of lease signing as August is the last month of our lease.
Please respond as soon as possible regarding the June rent payment. I can also fedex a flat-rate envelope for June and July rent checks to expedite this. Thank you

From: Stephen J. Boerner
To: Luther J. Rollins, Jr.
Text Detail: 06-10-2024 / 12:32:38
Hi luther, spoke to melissa. $4,500/month is higher than we would prefer coming into this phase in life.
She brought up good points i agree with and found an alternative im seeing shortly. Let’s call it “nesting.” This is where i follow her lead and put my preferences on the back burner. Mamma instinct kickin in which is a beautiful thing to see.
That said, one option she was open to was a 1 or two month extension without the commitment to extend. But the price would need to be less.
I respect, and understand, you and your wife’s stance in terms of pricing such a perfect home. For the sake of collecting answers for Melissa, are you open to a decreased monthly cost for 1 or 2 months. If yes,I can take that to Melissa and have an answer no later than Wednesday morning so we can agree or not agree on extending. Not extending at lower monthly for 1-2 months would mean we would move on and say goodbye/thank you and pursue ensuring our security deposit by leaving the home in good standing as it exists today.

From: Luther J. Rollins, Jr.
To: Stephen J. Boerner
Text Detail: 06-10-2024 / 13:31:19
Hi Steve,
Good info and update. I will discuss with my wife shortly and get back to you. Please keep in mind that the $4500 was a flat rent and we paid all utilities, electric, internet etc. So, not too high for a 2/2 house w/yard. Did you overnight the June rent check? This is now 10 days past due.
Thanks!

From: Stephen J. Boerner
To: Luther J. Rollins, Jr.
Text Detail: 06-11-2024 / 11:37:41
Luther,
Please compensate yourself for our late June payment. I can either send a late fee via check or you can deduct the late fee from the security deposit. Or, however you would prefer. Its not right to be this late and its my responsibility. No favors please.
The June and July checks were sent via USPS. I asked they be FedEx overnighted but she didnt have time to go inside a fedex and my golf cart is currently out of commission. Doesnt matter the reasons just know that both June and July rent checks are in the mail. Both checks are dated June 10th 2024 so you can deposit July early. Our accounts are restored with more than enough to cover both checks. Wont have an issue.
Again, i apologize for this. I understand the frustration and any concern. With the June and July check en route to you, once processed, we are all paid up through August 31st as August was paid as part of the first/last/security deposit paid upfront at lease signing.
As of now, we will plan to be out of the house by August 31st as i dont blame you for not wanting to offer discounted months after August 31st when the 10-month lease concludes.
Thank you.

Hi Stephen,
Thanks for the update. Hope you get the golf cart up and going. Would a discounted one month (Sept.) extender be useful for you & Melissa?
Otherwise, we will proceed to end in August as stated in the lease. Thanks!

I’m sure my wife would agree to a rate of $125×30 for September. So, it would be total $3,750

Ok no rush just making sure i didnt miss anything in the mail. I can sign a pdf and return just as easily if sending email is preferred, then just need final executed version with both signatures. If using snail mail, please let me know when to expect it as we dont grab the mail every day. Thanks Luther

Luther, such is life to be this unpredictable. But the path forward for our nesting period
Has shifted with new information .
I speak from both Melissa and I when I say thank you for a wonderful stay and being a great landlord
our need to extend into a single, discounted month has shifted and to declining that option as a result of new life information on our end in which I will spare you the detail but all is positive.
That said we are opting to not sign the one month extension and I thank you for expediting it.
60 days from today is August 31, 2024 which marks the last day of our lease that is currently in agreement.

Zach and I had originally scheduled August 30 to do a walk-through but during our last walk-through when Zach was at the house he told me he cannot make it and will be out of town August 30 so he left a lockbox attached to the front door handle and gave me the code so I could put my keys in the lock box on my way out. I told him I would notify him when I walked out of the house for the last time and my keys were secured in the lock box attached to the front door. I plan to be out of the house by 6 PM or 7 PM at the latest on Saturday , August 31st

If need be, you and I can speak on August 31st’s move-out day - or prior to that - just to align on specifics as I’m leaving them. We really want to feel good about turning the house over in equal/better condition than we found it outside of the few items shared with Zach such as minor storm damage and such. Also, Zach I’m sure mentioned to you the AC needing repair. Zach said he knew of an HVAC repair company to assist, but I haven’t heard of any next steps there. It should be addressed this week as you don’t want the issue sitting with no one there to monitor it

I can’t pick up but I read your voicemail. I will not be home this evening, but if you need to act fast on scheduling hvac , I can make myself available tomorrow at anytime as I am working from home tomorrow and Wednesday so anytime you want to schedule the hvac guy to come by, you can move forward without checking with me. Zach does not have to be there as I will be home tomorrow (Tuesday) and Wednesday all day both days . Does this give you the information you need right now in this moment or do you need me to call you at 6:15pm - 6:30pm as I mentioned that is my only window to speak this evening

I just left you a voicemail. I ran home to meet hvac repair guy. I’m here with him now and he’s working on the AC . I will touch base with you when I have more information from him, but the good news is is that I am home and he’s here working on it.

HVAC repair guy is returning Wednesday to complete the fix. He repaired it enough for now there is no leak and appears to be an easy solution. I aligned with the hvac repair guy in terms of him having my cell number to notify me directly as to what day and time he will be returning to the house. He will let you know as well as me so I have a heads up for his return

Hi Luther,
All is well and thank for the kind words and always being a fantastic person to rent from.
Melissa left some baked goods for me to pass around to those in Gulfport who were dear friends, helped us get settled, helped in times of difficulty, etc.
Will you be stopping by any time today? or perhaps tomorrow or Monday? If so, I will leave them here for you as well as Zach. If not, I won’t let them spoil and no problem at all. Wrapped up, it could last a week or so in the fridge here at the house as well
Anyway, baked goods aside, I have a crew arriving late this afternoon to haul the boxes and that will be that.

Don’t think my schedule will allow me to stop by. And I think Zach is away until Tuesday. So best to give the baked goods to others. I will do a close-out inspection and if things are okay
