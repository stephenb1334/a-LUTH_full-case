In April 2024, when Luther arrived for his on-site walkthrough, he

presented himself as a calm figure stepping onto the Florida property

he claimed to know so well, yet rarely saw in person. As we moved past

the sagging branches and approached the flimsy side gate—no latch, no

lock, the wood splintered at its edges—I asked him about his

profession. It felt natural, given the circumstances: he was a

landlord who lived hundreds of miles away, a man who had shown so

little urgency in addressing urgent hazards. The home invasion from

weeks prior, facilitated by that very gate and those dim, faulty

motion lights, still echoed in my mind. His demeanor, guarded and

measured, suggested he was choosing each word carefully.

“I’m a lawyer,” Luther said, in a tone that allowed no further detail.

He mentioned corporate law in passing, something about working in

North Carolina, but offered no clarity on the scope or ethics of his

practice. There was no explicit mention of handling Florida legal

matters—no, his words stayed in safe territory. Still, the very

admission that he was a licensed attorney raised the stakes. Here

stood a man trained in the precise interpretation of laws, someone who

should know better than to neglect statutory duties, someone who

understood perfectly well what Fla. Stat. §§83.49, 83.51, and 715.10–

715.111 demanded of him. And yet, rather than acting as a landlord

committed to the standards and safety requirements these statutes

imposed, he had persistently failed to comply.

Zach, the realtor who had been my local contact from the start, only

solidified Luther’s background when we spoke privately. Zach described

Luther’s multiple properties and hinted at aspirations of greater

collaboration, clearly revealing a personal stake that might

compromise his impartiality. For all Zach’s friendly demeanor, he had

an interest in pleasing Luther—the non-resident landlord, the attorney

with potential future listings—an interest that overshadowed any

concern he might have voiced about my living conditions or security.

Here was a potential conflict of interest that weighed heavily on my

rights as a tenant. If Zach stood to gain from maintaining a favorable

relationship with Luther, how could I rely on him to represent my

concerns fairly?

Despite Luther’s legal credentials, he allowed the property to remain

unsafe after a known violent home invasion. He failed to remedy the

hazardous tree limbs hanging near electrical cables, or to ensure that

the malfunctioning motion lights would do their job. He saw these

things in person, looked upon them with his own eyes, and then, as if

dismissing a minor inconvenience, simply moved on. For an attorney—

someone well aware that neglecting maintenance and safety breaches

clear statutory obligations—such inaction is more than an oversight.

It is a calculated choice.

Luther’s awareness and silence are damning. He wasn’t just some

uninformed landlord who didn’t know the rules; he was a trained legal

professional who opted to ignore them. His refusal to follow through

on previously mentioned security improvements, like installing metal

gates or ensuring functional lighting, placed me at ongoing risk and

psychic distress. Each day that passed without action deepened my

mistrust. It wasn’t a matter of ignorance; it was willful neglect, a

conscious decision to leave me with all the burdens the law meant for

him to shoulderLuther’s awareness and silence are damning. He wasn’t just some

psychic distress. Each day that passed without action deepened my

mistrust. It wasn’t a matter of ignorance; it was willful neglect, a

conscious decision to leave me with all the burdens the law meant for

him to shoulder.

Moreover, even if Luther’s position as a lawyer shielded him from

accusations of misrepresenting his professional status, that does not

absolve him of failing to uphold the very standards he, of all people,

should understand intimately. He did not need to be a Florida-licensed

attorney to know that common decency and statutory obligations are not

optional. The out-of-state legal practice he maintained does not grant

him immunity from Florida’s landlord-tenant laws when he chooses to

rent out property in that state. There’s no excuse for the

indifference he showed toward mandated maintenance duties, deposit

handling procedures, and personal property protocols set forth in

Florida Statutes.

Luther’s relationship with Zach only heightens the concern. Zach, as

the listing agent and the person who facilitated my entry into this

lease, should have been a neutral party. Instead, he appears to be

entangled in Luther’s broader business interests. His potential future

gains from working with Luther on subsequent transactions suggest that

his priority might lean more toward pleasing the landlord than

ensuring fair treatment for the tenant. This dynamic compromises the

reliability of any communication or promises channeled through Zach.

In the end, Luther’s credentials as a lawyer practicing outside of

Florida, combined with the confirmation from Zach, do not ease the

severity of his noncompliance with Florida’s landlord-tenant statutes.

Rather, they underscore the deliberate nature of his choices. He knew

what was required—timely deposit notices, essential repairs to secure

the premises, immediate responses to critical safety hazards—but chose

not to fulfill these duties. While he may not have blatantly

misrepresented his legal status, his willful negligence and refusal to

adhere to statutory requirements cannot be excused by credentials or

geography.

This is about a landlord, fully aware of the rules, intentionally

failing to follow them. No matter his professional qualifications, he

remains responsible for the safety, habitability, and legal compliance

of the property he chose to rent out. No matter Zach’s vested

interests, such conflicts do not dilute the landlord’s accountability.

The statutes exist to protect tenants, and no out-of-state license or

personal ambitions can alter that fact.

In conclusion, Luther’s confirmed status as a lawyer with a Missouri

Bar license and a corporate law background in North Carolina does not

mitigate the gravity of his failings in Florida. To the contrary, it

magnifies the deliberate nature of his inaction. This is someone who

cannot claim ignorance of legal obligations. The presence of Zach, who

could have served as an impartial local resource, is instead tainted

by his personal stake in pleasing Luther. All told, these factors

compound the seriousness of the statutory violations, leaving no doubt

The fact that Mr. Steinberger acted as both the listing agent for the home when it was for sale and later as the agent facilitating its rental could introduce concerns about conflict of interest, particularly if his dual roles influenced his advice or actions regarding the property. This dynamic could cast doubt on the objectivity of his opinions about tenant damages or his involvement in managing the property. Here’s how this potential conflict of interest could be framed to bolster your case:

Mr. Steinberger, as a licensed realtor, providing his professional opinion to Luther about tenant damages would not typically carry significant weight in a legal dispute unless Steinberger is qualified as an expert witness in property damage assessment, which is unlikely unless he has specific certifications or expertise beyond his real estate license.

Key Considerations:

1\. Professional Opinion in Context

• Role as a Realtor: Realtors often share professional opinions about property conditions, maintenance, and damages during their normal duties. If Steinberger was acting within his capacity as a realtor and simply providing observations or informal advice to Luther, it does not constitute a legal or ethical violation.

• Non-Binding Nature: Steinberger’s opinion would likely hold little to no legal weight unless backed by concrete evidence, formal inspections, or professional certifications (e.g., a licensed contractor or appraiser providing a detailed report on damages).

2\. Unauthorized Practice of Law

• Providing Legal Advice: If Steinberger advised Luther on legal actions, interpretation of laws, or how to pursue damages in court, it could border on the unauthorized practice of law. Florida law prohibits realtors from giving legal advice unless they are licensed attorneys.

• Drafting Legal Arguments: If Steinberger’s email goes beyond general professional advice and includes strategies for pursuing legal claims (e.g., advising how to interpret lease terms, draft legal documents, or argue in court), this could potentially be viewed as crossing a boundary into unauthorized legal practice.

3\. Violation of Realtor Ethics

• Realtors in Florida are bound by the Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice of the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and Florida’s professional standards:

• Article 13 of the NAR Code of Ethics prohibits realtors from engaging in activities that constitute the unauthorized practice of law.

• If Steinberger’s communication was limited to property-related matters (e.g., the extent of visible damage, costs of repair, or how to prepare the property for re-rental), it is unlikely to violate ethical standards.

4\. Potential Bias or Conflict of Interest

• Steinberger’s role as the realtor who facilitated the lease and served as Luther’s point of contact during the tenancy might introduce a perceived bias. His commission and ongoing relationship with Luther could be argued to create a financial incentive to support Luther’s claims. However, this would not inherently violate any laws or ethical rules unless Steinberger knowingly made false or misleading statements.

5\. Impact on Legal Proceedings

• Weight of Opinion: Courts typically require documented, objective evidence to substantiate claims of property damage. Steinberger’s opinion, unless based on verifiable inspections or expert assessments, would likely carry minimal weight in court.

• Testimony in Court: If Steinberger’s opinions were introduced in a legal dispute, they could be challenged as lacking objectivity or expertise unless he is deemed qualified to testify on the nature and extent of damages.

Summary of Violations or Concerns:

No Violation if Limited to Professional Property Opinions: If Steinberger merely provided his observations or informal advice about the property’s condition or damages, there is no violation of law or ethics.

Potential Issue if Offering Legal Advice: If Steinberger advised Luther on pursuing damages legally, interpreting the lease, or taking specific legal actions, this could be considered unauthorized practice of law.

Minimal Legal Weight: Steinberger’s professional opinion would hold little weight in court unless supported by evidence or a recognized qualification as an expert in property damage.

Conclusion:

Mr. Steinberger’s role in advising Luther on tenant damages is not inherently a violation unless it crosses into legal advice or false statements. His opinion likely serves as informal guidance rather than a decisive legal or expert determination, and any claims Luther pursues based on Steinberger’s advice would still need to be substantiated by evidence or third-party inspections to hold up in court.

Conflict of Interest and Its Impact on Credibility

1\. Dual Roles and Financial Incentive

• Financial Stake in Both Transactions: As the listing agent for the home when it was for sale and later as the rental agent, Mr. Steinberger had a clear financial incentive tied to the property’s value, marketability, and income potential. His commission for both the sale and rental agreements creates a perceived bias toward maintaining favor with the landlord, Luther Rollins.

• This bias undermines the neutrality required to assess tenant-related issues, particularly damages.

• His relationship with Luther as a commissioned agent inherently incentivizes alignment with the landlord’s interests, not objective fact-finding.

2\. Lack of Objectivity in Assessing Tenant Damages

• Motivated to Protect Future Earnings: Steinberger’s continued role in the property’s rental management ties his financial success to his ongoing relationship with Luther Rollins. Any advice or opinions he provided about tenant damages could have been influenced by the desire to:

• Preserve his professional relationship with Luther.

• Protect the property’s future rental or resale value.

• Avoid accountability for failing to disclose property issues during its listing or rental phases.

• Undermined Credibility in Court: Courts and legal proceedings typically weigh the objectivity of witness testimony, particularly from professionals. Steinberger’s dual roles as listing and rental agent call into question whether his opinions regarding tenant damages were impartial or motivated by self-interest.

3\. Professional Ethics and Realtor Guidelines

• Realtor Code of Ethics Violation: According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR) Code of Ethics:

• Article 1 obligates realtors to protect and promote the interests of their clients while being honest and fair with all parties.

• Article 11 requires realtors to perform only services for which they are qualified and to disclose their conflicts of interest.

• Article 12 prohibits false or misleading statements about the condition of a property.

• If Steinberger provided an opinion about tenant damages without sufficient inspection or expertise, or if his role as the listing agent influenced his statements, he could be seen as violating these ethical standards.

4\. Conflict of Interest as a Realtor and Property Manager

• Potential Compromised Neutrality: Steinberger’s role as both the agent responsible for securing the tenant and as the property manager during the lease term makes him an inherently partial party in any disputes between the landlord and tenant. His financial incentive to maintain good standing with Luther compromises his ability to act neutrally.

• If his advice to Luther about tenant damages was overly favorable or exaggerated, it raises the question of whether he prioritized maintaining his relationship with Luther over impartial evaluation.

• This conflict weakens the credibility of any opinions Steinberger provides about tenant damages.

Using the Conflict of Interest in Your Defense

To leverage this potential conflict of interest, your argument could focus on these key points:

Financial Incentive and Lack of Objectivity:  
• Steinberger’s dual roles as listing agent and rental agent created a financial dependency on the landlord, making his opinions about tenant damages inherently biased. Courts are unlikely to weigh opinions influenced by financial incentives as credible.

Undisclosed Conflict of Interest:  
• Steinberger acted as both the rental agent and landlord’s representative but did not disclose this conflict of interest when providing his opinions on tenant damages. This dual role undermines his ability to act impartially and raises ethical concerns under the NAR Code of Ethics.

Realtor Duties and Ethical Violations:  
• Steinberger’s ethical obligations under the Realtor Code of Ethics require neutrality and honesty. His financial relationship with Luther Rollins and his involvement in both the sale and rental of the property compromise his credibility and objectivity in assessing tenant damages.

Compromised Testimony:  
• Any testimony or evidence Steinberger provides in support of tenant damages must be scrutinized through the lens of his dual roles and financial motivations. His statements should carry minimal weight unless backed by third-party evidence or formal property assessments.

The dual roles Steinberger held as listing agent and rental agent introduce a clear conflict of interest, significantly undermining the credibility and weight of any opinions he provided about tenant damages. His financial dependency on the landlord and his ongoing relationship with the property owner suggest his advice may have been influenced by self-interest, not impartial judgment. This conflict should be emphasized in any legal proceedings to question the validity of Steinberger’s involvement and diminish the impact of his statements or actions supporting Luther Rollins’ claims.
