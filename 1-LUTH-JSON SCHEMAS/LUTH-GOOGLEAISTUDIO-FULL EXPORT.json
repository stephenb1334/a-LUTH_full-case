Tenants Stephen Boerner and Melissa Bemer raise claims against Landlords Luther J. Rollins, Jr. and Mary O. Polk regarding the handling of their security deposit, the habitability of the premises, the withholding of personal property, alleged misrepresentations concerning the landlord entity and address, and the conduct of the landlords' agent, Zach Steinberger. The lease term was from October 31, 2023, to August 31, 2024, with a subsequent one-month extension through September 30, 2024.

        "reasoning": "Under Florida Statute § 83.49(3)(a) (2023), a landlord who intends to impose a claim on a security deposit must notify the tenant in writing by certified mail to the tenant's last known mailing address within 30 days of the tenant vacating the premises. The notice must state the landlord's intention and the reasons for the claim. If the landlord fails to give the required notice within the 30-day period, the landlord forfeits the right to impose a claim upon the security deposit. ANALYSIS UNDER 2023 LAW: The Tenants vacated on or around September 30, 2024. Under the 2023 statutory framework, this creates a deadline of October 30, 2024 for proper notice. The Landlord's letter asserting a claim and offering settlement is dated November 8, 2024, which is more than 30 days after September 30, 2024 under 2023 calculations. Furthermore, the Tenants' attempt to dispute an earlier (presumed) claim was hampered by an incorrect address provided by the Landlord. The Landlord's November 8 letter itself acknowledges receipt of the Tenants' 'Formal Tenant Response & Dispute,' implying a prior claim notice was sent by the Landlord. However, the timeliness and proper delivery of that initial claim notice by the Landlord are in question under 2023 standards, especially given the address issues. Under 2023 law, if the Landlord's initial notice of intent to claim the deposit was not sent via certified mail to the correct last known address or was not sent within 30 days of September 30, 2024, the Landlord has forfeited the right to claim the deposit.",
        "conclusion": "Under 2023 Florida Statute § 83.49(3)(a), the Landlords likely failed to comply with the strict notice requirements by not sending a timely notice of claim on the security deposit within 30 days of the Tenants vacating the premises. The November 8, 2024 letter is outside this window under 2023 law. If no prior timely and properly delivered notice was sent under 2023 standards, the Landlords have forfeited their right to the security deposit.",

ANALYSIS UNDER 2023 LAW: 1. Clogged Sink: Tenants reported a severely clogged sink in January 2024, rendering it unsanitary for over 15 days. Under 2023 maintenance standards, the Landlord's failure to arrange repairs within a reasonable timeframe, forcing Tenants to resolve it, constitutes a breach of Fla. Stat. § 83.51(1)(b) (2023). 2. Faulty Motion Lights & Unsecured Gates: Following a break-in in March 2024, Tenants reported faulty motion lights and deteriorating, non-locking gates. Under 2023 safety standards, the Landlord acknowledged these but failed to make adequate repairs despite an on-site visit in April 2024 and subsequent video evidence of the faulty lights. This failure to maintain the premises in a safe condition, particularly features relevant to security after a break-in, constitutes a breach of Fla. Stat. § 83.51(1) (2023) under the habitability standards that were in effect in 2023.",
        "conclusion": "Under 2023 Florida Statute § 83.51, the Landlords breached their duty by failing to timely repair the clogged kitchen sink and by failing to address the faulty motion lights and unsecured gates, especially after being put on notice of their impact on tenant safety following a break-in.

If a landlord believes property has been abandoned, specific notice procedures must be followed before disposing of or selling the property. ANALYSIS UNDER 2023 LAW: On September 4, 2024, Tenant Boerner informed Landlord Rollins of his intent to retrieve belongings and his indefinite departure. On the same day, the Landlord, through his agent Zach Steinberger, instructed Steinberger to cease communication about the items. Under 2023 statutory procedures, this action, combined with the Landlord's subsequent letter (November 8, 2024) where he states he cannot confirm or deny the presence of items and offers $500 for them, suggests a failure to follow 2023 statutory procedures for handling tenant property. Under 2023 law, the Landlord was required to provide the statutory notice regarding the property and facilitate its retrieval according to established procedures. Instead, communication was cut off by the agent at the Landlord's direction, violating 2023 personal property disposition requirements.",
        "conclusion": "Under 2023 Florida Statutes §§ 715.10-715.111, the Landlords likely violated the prescribed procedures for handling the Tenants' personal property and impeded its retrieval. Under 2023 law, the Tenants may be entitled to the value of the property plus statutory remedies.",

        "reasoning": "ANALYSIS UNDER 2023 LAW: 1. Landlord Address Disclosure (Fla. Stat. § 83.50 (2023)): The lease agreement identified the Landlord's agent for notices (Zach Steinberger) at the rental property address itself (2649 Tifton St S). Under 2023 Fla. Stat. § 83.50, disclosure of the name and address of the landlord or a person authorized to receive notices was required. While an agent could be authorized under 2023 law, providing the tenant's own rental address as the point of contact for the landlord/agent was misleading and potentially non-compliant under 2023 standards if it didn't represent a true address where the landlord or authorized agent could receive notices independently of the tenant's presence. 2. Amarlu Enterprises & Foreign LLC Registration (Fla. Stat. § 605.0902 (2023)): Rent payments were directed to Amarlu Enterprises, an entity not named in the lease. Under 2023 law, this entity, associated with the Landlords, was reportedly not registered to conduct business in Florida. Fla. Stat. § 605.0902(1) (2023) stated a foreign LLC may not transact business in Florida until it files a certificate of authority. Fla. Stat. § 605.0904(1) (2023) stated a foreign LLC transacting business in Florida without a certificate of authority may not maintain a proceeding in any court in this state until it obtains one. However, § 605.0904(2) (2023) stated that the failure of a foreign LLC to obtain a certificate of authority does not impair the validity of a contract or act of the company. Under 2023 law, while the lease itself may not be automatically invalidated solely on this ground for the purpose of tenant obligations, the lack of disclosure and the collection of rent by an unregistered entity not party to the lease constituted a significant misrepresentation and lack of transparency under 2023 standards.",
        "conclusion": "Under 2023 Florida law, the Landlords likely violated Fla. Stat. § 83.50 by providing a potentially improper or misleading address for receiving notices. The collection of rent by Amarlu Enterprises, an unregistered foreign LLC not party to the lease, constitutes a misrepresentation and a violation of 2023 Florida's LLC registration laws, though it may not automatically invalidate the lease for all purposes under 2023 standards, it undermines the Landlord's ability to enforce it in Florida courts without registration and supports claims of bad faith under 2023 law.",

        "reasoning": "ANALYSIS UNDER 2023 LAW: Zach Steinberger, as a licensed real estate professional, was bound by 2023 Florida real estate laws and ethical codes. The Non-Lawyer Disclosure form signed by all parties explicitly stated he cannot give legal advice under 2023 professional standards. The Tenants' statement alleges Steinberger provided a \"professional opinion to not refund the security deposit\" and acted as an unqualified damage assessor. Under 2023 law, if true, offering such opinions, especially on the legal and financial disposition of a security deposit, likely constituted giving unauthorized legal or financial advice, exceeding his role as a real estate agent under 2023 professional conduct standards. His dual role as listing agent and landlord's agent for notices, while not per se illegal under 2023 law if disclosed, required careful navigation to avoid prioritizing one party's interests unfairly. His instruction from the Landlord to cease communication regarding personal property retrieval also implicated him in the Landlord's potential statutory violations under 2023 standards.",
        "conclusion": "Under 2023 Florida law, Zach Steinberger likely acted outside the scope of his real estate license by offering opinions that could be construed as legal or financial advice regarding the security deposit and damage assessment.

        "reasoning": "ANALYSIS UNDER 2023 LAW: The use of identical Authentisign IDs for distinct individuals (Luther & Mary Polk; Stephen & Melissa Bemer) was a significant irregularity in the e-signature process under 2023 standards. Under 2023 law, each signer should have had a unique identifier to ensure the integrity and non-repudiation of their signature. This raised questions about the proper execution and authentication of the lease agreement under 2023 electronic signature standards. While Florida's Electronic Signature Act (Fla. Stat. § 668.50 (2023)) gave legal recognition to electronic signatures, under 2023 law the process must reliably establish the identity of the signer and their intent. Overlapping or identical IDs for different parties undermined this reliability under 2023 standards. Furthermore, under 2023 professional practices, the failure to provide a fully executed copy of the lease (including all signatures and pages) to the Tenants until after the lease term ended and upon request was a breach of standard practice and transparency, potentially hindering the Tenants' ability to understand their full rights and obligations during the tenancy.",
        "conclusion": "Under 2023 Florida law, the irregularities in the Authentisign IDs raise serious concerns about the integrity of the electronic execution of the lease. While this may not automatically invalidate the entire lease under 2023 standards if occupancy and rent payment occurred, it could be a factor in determining the enforceability of specific clauses or in assessing claims of bad faith or misrepresentation under 2023 law. The delayed provision of the fully executed lease was a failure in 2023 professional practice standards.",

Under Florida Statute § 83.53(3) (2023), a landlord was prohibited from abusing the right of access or using it to harass the tenant. While this statute under 2023 law primarily pertained to physical access, a pattern of unwanted and persistent communication, especially if designed to pressure or intimidate, could potentially be argued as a form of harassment under 2023 standards, though this was a high bar to meet under 2023 law and typically required more egregious conduct. The Landlord's text on Oct 29, 2024, stating he called 'a couple times today to discuss the Tenant Response & Dispute' and hoping to 'resolve amicably' was, on its face under 2023 standards, not necessarily harassment but an attempt to communicate. Under 2023 law, the context of prior requests for written communication and the nature/frequency of calls would be important factors.",
        "conclusion": "Under 2023 Florida law, while the Landlord's attempts to communicate by phone regarding the dispute may be perceived as pressure by the Tenants, they do not, based solely on the provided excerpts, definitively rise to the level of statutory harassment under 2023 Florida landlord-tenant law without further evidence of egregious or abusive patterns. However, under 2023 standards, ignoring a tenant's reasonable request for written communication in a dispute context could contribute to an atmosphere of bad faith.",
