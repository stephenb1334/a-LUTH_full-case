# CLAIM: UNLAWFUL OBSTRUCTION OF ACCESS TO PERSONAL PROPERTY AND CONVERSION

**I. Introduction**

This claim asserts that the landlord, Luther Rollins, has unlawfully obstructed the tenant's access to their personal property, violating Florida Statutes §83.67 and §715.104, and has engaged in the conversion of said property. The landlord's actions include directing his agent to cease communication with the tenant, failing to respond to the tenant's attempts to retrieve their belongings, misrepresenting the tenant's intent, and ultimately converting the tenant's property for his own use. These actions demonstrate a pattern of bad faith and willful disregard for the tenant's rights under Florida law.

**II. Parties**

*   **Claimant (Tenant):** [Your Name]
*   **Respondent (Landlord):** Luther Rollins
*   **Agent (Realtor):** Zach Steinberger

**III. Factual Background**

1.  **Lease Termination:** The lease agreement between the Claimant and Respondent terminated on [Date of Lease Termination].
2.  **Personal Property Left Behind:** Due to storm-related delays, the Claimant left certain personal property on the premises, including a Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill and other items.
3.  **Intent to Retrieve Property:** On September 4, 2024, the Claimant sent a text message to the Respondent stating, "Hi Luther, I’m leaving town tonight indefinitely. It’s the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property. I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank you." This message clearly indicated the Claimant's intent to retrieve their belongings, not to abandon them.
4.  **Landlord's Directive to Cease Communication:** Following the text message, the Respondent instructed his agent, Zach Steinberger, to cease all communication with the Claimant. This directive is evidenced by:
    *   **Text Message from Zach Steinberger:** [Insert the exact text message from Zach Steinberger where he states he was instructed to cease communication].
    *   **Landlord's Instruction:** The landlord's instruction to Zach Steinberger to cease communication is a direct attempt to obstruct the tenant's access to their personal property.
5.  **Tenant's Attempts to Retrieve Property:** The Claimant made multiple written requests to the Respondent, dated September 25, 2024, and September 27, 2024, for access to retrieve their personal property. These requests were ignored by both the Respondent and his agent.
6.  **Misrepresentation of Abandonment:** The Respondent selectively quoted the Claimant's September 4th text message to imply abandonment, misrepresenting the full context and the Claimant's clear intent to retrieve their belongings.
7.  **Conversion of Property:** The Respondent has used the Claimant's personal property, specifically the Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill, to market the rental property as an amenity, demonstrating an unlawful conversion of the Claimant's property.

**IV. Legal Claims**

1.  **Violation of Florida Statute §83.67(2):**
    *   Florida Statute §83.67(2) states, "A landlord of any dwelling unit governed by this part shall not prevent the tenant from gaining reasonable access to the dwelling unit by any means..."
    *   While this section explicitly addresses physical access to the dwelling unit, the overarching principle is the prohibition of any action by the landlord to prevent the tenant from exercising their rights.
    *   The Respondent's directive to cease communication, combined with his failure to respond to the Claimant's requests, effectively prevented the Claimant from gaining reasonable access to their personal property.
    *   The Respondent's actions constitute a violation of the spirit and intent of §83.67, as they actively obstructed the Claimant's right to retrieve their belongings.
2.  **Violation of Florida Statute §715.104:**
    *   Florida Statute §715.104(1) states, "After taking possession of the premises... the landlord shall give written notice to the former tenant... stating that the property is considered abandoned and that the landlord intends to dispose of it if not claimed."
    *   The Respondent failed to provide the Claimant with the required written notice regarding their personal property.
    *   The Respondent's failure to respond to the Claimant's requests for retrieval further demonstrates a violation of this statute.
    *   The Respondent's actions demonstrate a clear disregard for the legally mandated procedures concerning the handling of a tenant's abandoned personal property.
3.  **Conversion of Personal Property:**
    *   The Respondent's use of the Claimant's Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill to market the rental property constitutes conversion, which is the unauthorized use and control of another's property inconsistent with their ownership rights.
    *   The Respondent exercised dominion over the Claimant's belongings in a manner that is inconsistent with the Claimant's ownership rights.
    *   The Respondent's actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for the Claimant's ownership and a clear intent to benefit from the Claimant's property without their consent.
4.  **Bad Faith and Coercive Communication:**
    *   The Respondent's repeated phone calls and text messages urging the Claimant to engage in a phone call, despite the Claimant's explicit request for written communication, constitute harassment and an attempt to coerce the Claimant into abandoning their rights.
    *   The Respondent's misrepresentation of the legal process, implying that the Claimant was legally required to engage in verbal communication, is another attempt to circumvent the Claimant's rights.
    *   The Respondent's actions, especially his knowledge of the Claimant's PTSD, indicate an intentional disregard for the Claimant's rights, suggesting bad faith.

**V. Damages**

As a direct result of the Respondent's unlawful actions, the Claimant is entitled to the following damages:

1.  **Full Return of Security Deposit:** $4,500.00
2.  **Value of Personal Property:** $4,210.62 (value of personal property, including the Weber grill, minus any applicable depreciation)
3.  **Statutory Damages:** Three months' rent, as provided by §715.109, totaling $13,500.00
4.  **Punitive Damages:** To be determined by the court, based on the Respondent's willful and malicious conduct.
5.  **Emotional Distress Damages:** To be determined by the court, based on the Respondent's actions exacerbating the Claimant's PTSD.
6.  **Attorney's Fees and Costs:** As provided by Florida law, if the court finds the Respondent's actions were willful or malicious.

**VI. Conclusion**

The Respondent's actions clearly constitute a violation of the Claimant's rights, including an obstruction of access to their personal property, a failure to follow the proper procedures for handling abandoned property, a misrepresentation of the Claimant's intent, and the conversion of the Claimant's property. The Respondent's directive to cease communication, combined with his failure to respond to the Claimant's requests, and the coercive communication tactics all strengthen the Claimant's legal claims. Given the extent of these violations, the Claimant is well-positioned to seek significant damages.

**VII. Demand**

The Claimant demands that the Respondent immediately:

1.  Return the full security deposit of $4,500.00.
2.  Compensate the Claimant for the full value of their personal property, totaling $4,210.62.
3.  Pay statutory damages of $13,500.00, as provided by §715.109. (Plus Pet Deposit of $500 = $14,000)
4.  Compensate the Claimant for punitive damages, emotional distress damages, attorney's fees, and court costs.

The Claimant is prepared to pursue all available legal remedies to ensure that their rights are protected and that the Respondent is held accountable for their unlawful actions.




# ATEMPTING TO WAIVE OR CIRCUMVENT STATUTORY TENANT RIGHTS, UNLAWFUL OBSTRUCTION OF ACCESS TO PERSONAL PROPERTY, AND CONVERSION

**I. Introduction**

This claim asserts that the landlord, Luther J. Rollins, Jr., has engaged in multiple violations of Florida law, including the unlawful obstruction of access to the tenant's personal property, the conversion of said property, and the attempt to circumvent statutory tenant rights through invalid lease provisions. Florida Statute §83.47 explicitly voids and renders unenforceable any clause within a rental agreement that attempts to waive or limit the rights, remedies, or requirements set forth in the Florida Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (Part II of Chapter 83). This legal protection is paramount to ensuring fairness and maintaining statutory integrity in the landlord-tenant relationship. The Landlord, through his actions and omissions, has violated this fundamental principle by failing to adhere to the mandatory statutory requirements, and has further attempted to shield himself from liability through invalid lease provisions.

    *   The Respondent's failure to respond to the Claimant's requests for retrieval further demonstrates a violation of this statute.
    *   The Respondent's actions demonstrate a clear disregard for the legally mandated procedures concerning the handling of a tenant's abandoned personal property.

3.  Conversion of Personal Property:
    *   The Respondent's use of the Claimant's Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill to market the rental property constitutes conversion, which is the unauthorized use and control of another's property inconsistent with their ownership rights.
    *   The Respondent exercised dominion over the Claimant's belongings in a manner that is inconsistent with the Claimant's ownership rights.

**V. Legal Basis: Florida Statute §83.47**

Florida Statute §83.47(1) states unequivocally:

> A provision in a rental agreement is void and unenforceable to the extent that it:
> (a) Purports to waive or preclude the rights, remedies, or requirements set forth in this part.
> (b) Purports to limit or preclude any liability of the landlord to the tenant or of the tenant to the landlord, arising under law.

This statute is a cornerstone of tenant protection in Florida, ensuring that the protections offered by the Florida Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (Part II of Chapter 83) remain intact, regardless of the terms in a lease agreement. It directly prohibits any attempt to contract away the statutory obligations and liabilities imposed on landlords. The intention behind this statute is clear: to prevent landlords from exploiting tenants through unequal and unjust lease agreements.

**VI. Core Elements of the Claim**

This claim rests on several key components derived from the language and intent of Florida Statute §83.47:

1.  Prohibition of Waiver of Statutory Rights:
    *   Any attempt to include provisions in the lease agreement that explicitly or impliedly waive or preclude the tenant’s right to pursue statutory remedies or fulfill the legal requirements is void and unenforceable. This includes any clause that suggests a tenant has relinquished their rights to a proper accounting of the security deposit, habitable living conditions, or safe and lawful handling of their personal property. The lease cannot legally state that you give up these rights.
    *   For example, the landlord cannot use lease language to circumvent his responsibility to adhere to the notice requirements under Florida Statute §83.49, or attempt to reduce the timeframe for a proper itemized list of damages beyond the statutorily allowed 30 days, nor his responsibility to allow the tenant to retrieve their personal property under Florida Statute §715.104.
2.  Invalidity of Liability Limitation:
    *   Any lease provision that attempts to limit or remove the liability of the landlord to the tenant is void. This means that the landlord cannot use the lease to protect himself from the repercussions of violating any Florida law. For example, the landlord cannot write a clause into the lease stating they are not responsible for maintaining the property in a habitable condition, because Florida Statute §83.51(1) imposes this responsibility on landlords.
    *   A lease cannot limit or remove the landlord’s statutory duty to handle the tenant’s security deposit according to law; their responsibility for safety issues on the property; nor their liability regarding unauthorized use of tenant’s personal property.
3.  Protection Against Unfair Contracts:
    *   Florida law recognizes an inherent imbalance of power between landlords and tenants, with the landlord often holding a disproportionate advantage in the lease agreement. Florida Statute §83.47 seeks to level the playing field by nullifying any contractual provisions that exploit the tenants’ vulnerability by denying their rights under law. This ensures that no tenant is forced to surrender their statutorily granted protections merely by signing an unjust lease agreement.
    *   The statutes are enacted as a consumer protection, to protect the tenants and prevent any sort of abuse, exploitation or avoidance of statutorial responsibility, and to promote fairness and equal protection under law.
4.  Supremacy of Statute over Lease Terms:
    *   It is critical to understand that a lease agreement is not the supreme authority in landlord-tenant relations in Florida. Instead, the Florida statutes, especially Part II of Chapter 83, establish non-negotiable tenant rights and landlord obligations.
    *   Any terms within a lease that conflict with these statutory provisions are automatically null and unenforceable and hold no legal weight. The statutory provisions override any contrary lease terms.
5.  Good Faith Obligation:
    *   Florida law, specifically Florida Statute §83.44, mandates a duty of good faith in the performance and enforcement of every contract, including lease agreements. Landlords cannot attempt to use lease terms to evade their statutory obligations, and any attempt to do so constitutes a violation of good faith practices and is further evidence of an intent to exploit or abuse the tenant's statutorily granted protections.
    *   Therefore, any attempt by the landlord to exploit or avoid obligations under law through language in the lease agreement is a demonstration of bad faith, and a further violation of this standard.

**VII. Application of §83.47 to Landlord’s Actions and Claims**

The landlord, Luther J. Rollins, Jr., has committed multiple violations of the aforementioned principles, which render his actions unlawful and his claims against the tenant invalid. These violations include but are not limited to:

1.  Security Deposit Mismanagement:
    *   The landlord failed to adhere to the requirements of Florida Statute §83.49 by not providing an itemized list of damages, accompanied by necessary receipts and documentation, within 30 days of lease termination. A lease clause attempting to remove or reduce this itemization requirement is void and unenforceable.
    *   The landlord’s vague claim of “damage to walls” and “missing items” was provided without supporting detail or receipts, as mandated by law, nor was any initial inventory or walk through provided to serve as a baseline for comparison.
2.  Illegal Withholding of Personal Property
    *   The landlord has violated Florida Statute §715.104 by failing to properly notify the tenant about the abandoned property, failing to allow the tenant reasonable access for retrieval of said belongings, and the blatant misuse of that property in the continued marketing of the rental unit.
    *   Any lease provision that might attempt to limit, preclude, or supersede the landlord's statutorial obligation to properly handle the tenant’s personal property under Florida Statute §715.104 is void and unenforceable.
3.  Habitability Concerns
    *   While the lease might specify certain maintenance responsibilities, any clause that attempts to completely absolve the landlord of their obligation to provide a safe, habitable property under Florida Statute §83.51(1) is invalid. Landlords have a continuing duty to maintain safe living conditions for their tenants.
4.  Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)
    *   The landlord’s communications, often using the email *luther2law@gmail.com*, and his references to legal obligations within the lease, imply that he is a legal professional, while in fact he has not provided any verifiable legal credentials or licensure. This may constitute a violation of  Florida Bar Rule 4-7.13 and Fla. Stat. §454.23 prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law (UPL) or any misrepresentation of one’s legal status. Any clause in a lease to circumvent this legal standard would be void and unenforceable.
5.  Foreign Entity Violations
    *   The fact that the landlord directed all payments to Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina entity not disclosed in the lease and unregistered as a foreign entity in Florida, violates Florida Statute § 605.0902, and may render the lease null and unenforceable, undermining their ability to claim damages against the security deposit. Any clauses in a lease attempting to avoid or circumvent this statute would also be void and unenforceable.

**VIII. The Lease and the Tenant's Rights**

Despite any language to the contrary in the lease agreement, the tenant's statutory rights, remedies, and protections are paramount. The lease is subservient to and governed by the statutory protections afforded to tenants under Florida Law. The lease agreement is void and unenforceable to the extent that it attempts to circumvent or limit the tenant's rights, and that the landlord cannot evade statutory requirements by including unfavorable terms within the lease.

**IX. Damages**

As a direct result of the Respondent's unlawful actions, the Claimant is entitled to the following damages:

1.  Full Return of Security Deposit: $4,500.00
2.  Value of Personal Property: $4,210.62 (value of personal property, including the Weber grill, minus any applicable depreciation)
3.  Statutory Damages: Three months’ rent, as provided by §715.109, totaling $13,500.00
4.  Punitive Damages: To be determined by the court, based on the Respondent's willful and malicious conduct.
5.  Emotional Distress Damages: To be determined by the court, based on the Respondent's actions exacerbating the Claimant's PTSD.
6.  Attorney's Fees and Costs: As provided by Florida law, if the court finds the Respondent's actions were willful or malicious.

**X. Conclusion and Legal Position**

Based on the foregoing analysis and the irrefutable legal premise established by Florida Statute §83.47, any terms in the lease agreement that attempt to waive, limit, or circumvent the tenant's statutory protections are null and unenforceable. The landlord’s actions have demonstrated a consistent disregard for these statutory mandates and have resulted in significant harm to the tenant. Therefore, the landlord is not entitled to retain any portion of the security deposit, is liable for damages related to the unauthorized use of the tenant's personal property, and is subject to further punitive actions for his willful and flagrant violations. The tenant is therefore fully entitled to full restitution under Florida Law, as previously demanded, and seeks all available remedies for the Landlord's willful and flagrant violations.

**XI. Demand**

The Claimant demands that the Respondent immediately:

1.  Return the full security deposit of $4,500.00.
2.  Compensate the Claimant for the full value of their personal property, totaling $4,210.62.
3.  Pay statutory damages of $13,500.00, as provided by §715.109.
4.  Compensate the Claimant for punitive damages, emotional distress damages, attorney's fees, and court costs.

The Claimant is prepared to pursue all available legal remedies to ensure that their rights are protected and that the Respondent is held accountable for their unlawful actions.

**XII. Evidence**

The Claimant has the following evidence to support this claim:

1.  Text message from Zach Steinberger stating he was instructed to cease communication.
2.  Text message from the Claimant to the Respondent on September 4, 2024.
3.  Written requests from the Claimant to the Respondent, dated September 25, 2024, and September 27, 2024.
4.  Rental listings showing the Claimant's grill being used as an amenity.
5.  \[Any other relevant evidence, such as photos, emails, etc.]

## Claim for Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability, Negligence, Emotional Distress, and Loss of Use and Enjoyment

**Introduction:**

This claim is filed by [Tenant's Full Name], hereinafter referred to as "Plaintiff," against [Landlord's Full Name or Company Name], hereinafter referred to as "Defendant," for breaches of the implied warranty of habitability, negligence, infliction of emotional distress, and loss of use and enjoyment of the rental property located at [Rental Property Address], Gulfport, Florida, leased at a monthly rate of $4,500.

---

**Facts:**

1. **Lease Agreement:** On October 31, 2023, the Plaintiff entered into a 10-month lease agreement with the Defendant to rent the property located at 2649 Tifton St. S. Gulfport, FL 33711. The lease expired on August 31, 2024.

2. **Home Invasion Incident:** On March 26, 2024, a home invasion occurred at the aforementioned property. The perpetrator entered through a side gate, which was ajar due to a faulty latching mechanism and lack of a lock. The gate was constructed from deteriorating wood, further compromising security.

3. **Security Requests:** On March 28, 2024, within two days of the incident, Plaintiff formally requested via [Method of Communication, e.g., Email, Text] that Defendant install locking metal gates and security cameras to enhance the property's safety. 

4. **Landlord's Acknowledgment:** During an inspection on April 26, 2024, Defendant acknowledged the deteriorating condition of the wooden gates and suggested replacing them with metal gates but took no immediate action.

5. **Faulty Motion Lights:** On the same date, Plaintiff showed Defendant video evidence of the erratic behavior of the motion lights, which had been faulty since [Date of Tenancy Start or When Fault Was Noticed]. These lights were intended to deter intruders but instead caused distress due to their malfunctioning state.

6. **Mental Health Impact:** Following the home invasion, Plaintiff was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression on [Date of Diagnosis] by [Name of Medical Professional], directly linked to the incident. Plaintiff's therapy sessions increased from bi-weekly to weekly due to this condition, with sessions conducted by [Therapist's Name] in Gulfport, Florida.

7. **Continuous Rent Collection:** Despite these known safety issues, Defendant continued to collect rent at the rate of $4,500 per month from March 28, 2024, until the lease ended on August 31, 2024, without addressing the security concerns.

8. **Lack of Response:** Defendant did not respond to Plaintiff's April 26, 2024, text message with video evidence of the faulty motion lights, nor did they take any action regarding the security requests from March 28, 2024, until the lease concluded.

---

**Legal Basis for Claims:**

1. **Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability (Florida Statutes § 83.51(1))**:

- Defendant breached their duty under Florida law to maintain the rental property in a condition fit for human habitation by failing to repair or replace the faulty side gate and motion lights, which directly contributed to the unsafe environment leading to the home invasion.

2. **Negligence**:

- Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff to ensure the property was secure, especially after a violent incident. Defendant breached this duty by not acting on Plaintiff's requests for safety improvements from March 28, 2024, through to August 31, 2024, despite knowing the risks.

3. **Emotional Distress**:

- As a result of Defendant's negligence, Plaintiff suffered significant emotional distress, diagnosed as PTSD, anxiety, and depression, requiring increased therapeutic intervention, which directly impacts Plaintiff's quality of life.

4. **Loss of Use and Enjoyment**:

- Plaintiff experienced a substantial loss of use and enjoyment of the rental property due to Defendant's failure to address safety, living under constant fear and vigilance, which significantly altered the living experience expected from a rental costing $4,500 per month.

---

**Damages Sought:**

1. **Compensation for Breach of Warranty of Habitability:** Plaintiff seeks compensation for the five-month period from March 28, 2024, to August 31, 2024, at the full rental rate of $4,500 per month, totaling $22,500, or an amount to be determined by the court for the diminished value of the lease due to safety concerns.

2. **Damages for Negligence:** Plaintiff requests compensatory damages for out-of-pocket expenses related to increased therapy costs and potential future treatment, along with punitive damages due to the egregious nature of Defendant's negligence.

3. **Emotional Distress Damages:** Plaintiff seeks damages for the emotional distress caused, including all therapy costs from [Date of Increased Therapy] to the present, potential future therapy, and non-economic damages for pain, suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life, to be determined by the court.

4. **Loss of Use and Enjoyment:** Plaintiff requests a significant portion of the rent paid during the unsafe period as compensation for the loss of peaceful enjoyment of the property, considering the high rental cost and the compromised living conditions.

---

**Conclusion:**

Plaintiff respectfully requests that this court find Defendant liable for the aforementioned breaches and negligence, and awards Plaintiff the full measure of damages as outlined, along with any additional relief the court deems just and proper, including but not limited to court costs and reasonable attorney fees.

**C. STATUTORY COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS: A LABYRINTH OF ILLEGALITY**

  

**NORTH CAROLINA REQUIREMENTS**

The misuse of addresses in North Carolina suggests multiple statutory violations:

• **Violation of “No P.O. Box” Mandate (N.C.G.S. § 66-71.4):** Designating a P.O. Box for official business registration contravenes state requirements prohibiting such listings.

• **False Physical Location Representation:** Providing a fictitious street address undermines the transparency mandated by North Carolina business registration laws.

• **Improper Business Address Registration:** Bypassing required protocols for address registration indicates an unauthorized approach to business operations.

• **Non-Compliance with State Statutes:** These actions demonstrate a disregard for North Carolina’s statutory framework governing legitimate business registration.

  

**FEDERAL POSTAL REGULATIONS**

Certain practices raise further concerns at the federal level:

• **Misuse of Federal Facility Address:** Employing a federal facility address for business-related activities can violate postal regulations.

• **Improper Commercial Address Representation:** Portraying a false physical location for commercial dealings runs counter to established federal guidelines.

• **Potential Mail Fraud Concerns:** Utilizing misrepresented addresses and a P.O. Box may open questions about fraudulent practices.

• **USPS Policy Violations:** Failing to adhere to USPS standards for address usage underscores additional procedural breaches.

  

**IV. FLORIDA PROPERTY OPERATIONS AND COMPLIANCE: A SECOND ARENA OF ISSUES**

  

While problems arise in North Carolina, Florida-based concerns also affect property ownership and leasing.

**A. NO DISCLOSURE OF ENTITY TYPE - LLC:**  

**A. NO NOTICE WITHIN 30 DAYS - SECURITY DEPOSIT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, NO RESPONSE TO NUMBER OF HELD RENTALS IN FLORIDA** 

**A. PROPERTY OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE:**



• **Property Type:** Residential, located in Florida.

• **Legal Owner:** Titled to “Luther J. Rollins, Jr.” in individual capacity.

• **Ownership Documentation:** The property is recorded under a personal name, yet the day-to-day rent collection references “Amarlu Enterprises.”

• **Absence of Formal Management Company:** No official property management entity is in place.

• **No Registered Business Entity:** No corporate or LLC structure for Florida operations.

• **Informal Payment Collection:** Instructions to mail rent to a North Carolina P.O. Box, bypassing standard channels.

• **Unauthorized Business Activities:** Collecting rent in Florida without registering as a foreign or domestic entity appears to contravene state rules.

  

**B. LEASE AGREEMENT ANALYSIS: A MASTERCLASS IN OMISSION**

The lease for the Florida property raises questions of omission and questionable terms:

• **Document Structure:** The landlord’s personal names appear, but no mention is made of the entity (Amarlu Enterprises) that receives the rent.

• **Parties to Agreement:** Listed as “Luther Rollins” and “Mary O. Polk,” plus two tenant signatories.

• **Business Entity Identification:** The lease does not acknowledge Amarlu Enterprises, despite its role in collecting payments.

• **Management Company Information:** No disclosed property manager, leaving communication channels ambiguous.

• **Legal Operating Authority:** The lease gives no statement showing any valid registration in Florida.

• **State-Required Disclosures:** Lacking or incomplete references to mandated disclosures.

• **Payment Instructions vs. Actual Practice:** While the lease references the landlords personally, tenants were verbally told to send checks to a North Carolina address.

• **Mismatch in Named Parties:** The discrepancy between named landlords in the lease and the actual rent recipient calls legal clarity into question.

• **Improper Payment Processing:** No recognized banking or escrow procedure in evidence, an arrangement that can conflict with standard Florida landlord-tenant guidelines.

  

This environment suggests purposeful obfuscation, with Amarlu Enterprises left out of formal lease documents yet acting as the de facto recipient of rent. The above issues point toward a larger pattern of noncompliance in both North Carolina and Florida, exposing tenants to uncertain legal protections and subjecting the landlords to significant statutory and regulatory challenges.

  

**SUMMARY OF FACTS: AMARLU ENTERPRISES, AMARLU COMPANY, & AMARLU CONSULTANTS**

A dispute involving these entities—on one side, representing the interests of two individual tenants, and on the other, the landlords (Luther J. Rollins & Mary O. Polk)—reveals critical failures to honor Florida statutes and recognized landlord-tenant standards. The landlords’ arrangement involves undisclosed foreign entities, potential misrepresentations, and possible tax infractions, all undermining the lease’s enforceability under Florida law.

  

Although the lease lists only Luther and Mary in their personal capacities, $36,000 OF THE $45,000 of monthly rent amounts were ultimately funneled by the written instructions from Luther, arrived via package to 2649 Tifton St. S. Gulfport, FL 33711 on Nov 29, 2023 (30 days into the lease. Also, no mention of how tenants would be paying months 2-9 as months 1 and 10 were included as first, last month's rent with security deposit and pet fee equalling $14,000 move-in costs and the only amounts paid to Luther Rollins as instructed by Zach Steinberger in the move-in process to make cashiers check for $14,000 to Luther Rollins which tenants did), and the rest of the $50,000 ($45,000 + $4,500 security deposit + $500 pet deposit) to Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina entity never disclosed in the lease nor registered in Florida, contravening the transparency obligations placed on landlords. Such omissions violate foreign entity registration requirements, diminishing legal clarity for tenants.

  

**Landlord’s Use of Mr. Zachary “Zach” Steinberger**

The presence of Mr. Steinberger, a realtor potentially motivated by continued business dealings with Luther, complicates the situation. His input may be compromised by personal interests rather than an unbiased professional assessment, rendering it questionable in evaluating damages or compliance questions.

  

**Potential Legal Violations**

The approach of omitting Amarlu Enterprises from the lease, directing tenants to an unregistered foreign entity, and any attempt to obscure compliance with tax or licensure requirements raises various legal issues—ranging from unregistered foreign business activity and possible fraud to statutory noncompliance.

  

**OBSERVED VIOLATIONS**

1. **Foreign Entity Registration Violation (Florida Statutes § 605.0902)**

• Amarlu Enterprises, as a North Carolina-based business entity, collected Florida rent without registering as a foreign LLC.

2. **Transparency and Disclosure Failures**

• Rent was directed to an unrecognized party, Amarlu Enterprises, without tenants’ explicit knowledge or consent in the lease.

3. **Tax and Regulatory Concerns**

• The unregistered entity collecting rent raises questions about accurate state and federal tax compliance.

4. **Potential Fraud**

• Deliberate omission of Amarlu Enterprises in official documentation may demonstrate fraudulent intent to hide its involvement.

5. **Conflict of Interest**

• Realtor Zachary “Zach” Steinberger’s role as a prospective business partner may cast doubt on his impartiality in damage or lease matters.

  

**LANDLORD’S LEGAL VIOLATIONS**

1. **Failure to Register a Foreign Entity**

• Amarlu Enterprises is not registered in Florida despite conducting commercial business by collecting rental payments.

2. **Non-Disclosure of Amarlu Enterprises**

• The lease omits any mention of the entity receiving all funds, compromising transparency.

3. **Consequences of Non-Compliance**

• Unregistered entities commonly lose standing in Florida courts, making it problematic for them to assert claims in lease disputes.

  

**TENANT’S POSITION ON UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE LEASE**

  

The tenant argues that the lease cannot be enforced because:

• All rental payments were funneled through a non-disclosed and unregistered entity, violating Florida’s rules for foreign entities.

• Any claim for damages is overshadowed by these statutory breaches, likely nullifying the landlord’s attempts to enforce provisions related to the security deposit or alleged damages.

  

**Good Faith and Offset**

The tenant fulfilled rental obligations in good faith. Should any property damages exist, they would be nominal and must be offset against any statutory violations, deposit withholdings, or other improper actions by the landlord.

  

**LANDLORD’S CLAIM FOR ENTIRE $4,500 SECURITY DEPOSIT**

  

Under Fla. Stat. § 83.49, landlords must give precise, itemized notices with verifiable documentation. General allegations—excessive trash, spoiled food, unauthorized alterations, or unverified claims about missing furnishings—lack legal sufficiency if not supported by comprehensive before-and-after evidence.

  

**Connection to Unregistered Entity**

Because the landlord used a non-disclosed, unregistered foreign entity to handle funds, a court may find the entire arrangement defective. There is limited or no standing to enforce the lease’s clauses or to claim the security deposit in full, particularly absent compliant documentation.

  

**Lack of Evidence**

Minor incidents, such as minor cleaning or normal turnover items (spoiled food, minor scuffs), do not justify a total forfeiture of the deposit. Larger claims, like missing or damaged property, require signed inventory lists or detailed photos establishing the pre-tenancy condition.

  

**Legal Taint**

Since the landlord disregarded Florida’s foreign entity regulations, the legitimacy of any claim for damages or withheld security deposit is further compromised.

  

This neutral version omits any language that could be perceived as pressuring, threatening, or extortive. It focuses solely on factual statements, legal requirements, and the potential implications under relevant statutes.


### **Failure to Maintain a Habitable Property**

Under **Fla. Stat. §83.51(1)**, landlords are required to ensure properties meet all building, housing, and health codes. Key incidents during my tenancy include:

-   **January 2024:** A severely clogged kitchen sink rendered the property unsanitary for 15 days. You failed to arrange repairs, forcing me to handle the issue independently.
    
-   **March 2024:** Faulty motion lights and deteriorated gates facilitated a violent home invasion. Despite acknowledging these safety concerns, you took no action to address them.
    
-   **April 2024:** Overhanging tree limbs above outdoor electrical cables created hazardous conditions. Neglected vegetation, including bamboo, an alleged jackfruit tree, and other trees, added to safety risks.





### **January 2024: Failure to Address Critical Maintenance (Clogged Kitchen Sink)**

**Incident:**  
In **January 2024**, I reported a **severely clogged kitchen sink** that rendered one side of the sink unusable. Water stagnated for **15 consecutive days**, creating unsanitary and potentially hazardous living conditions. Despite my clear communications outlining the issue and requesting timely resolution, you failed to respond or take action to address the problem. Ultimately, after over two weeks of inaction, I was left with no choice but to resolve the issue independently at my own expense.

* * *

**Impact and Precedent Set:**  
Your complete lack of response and failure to fulfill your legal obligation to maintain the property set a **clear precedent** for how all future maintenance, sanitary, and safety concerns would be handled—or, rather, neglected—by you as the landlord. As a tenant living in **Florida** while you remained out of state in **North Carolina**, your geographic absence, combined with delays in communication (or outright silence), indicated to me that **immediate and urgent concerns** requiring action would have to be resolved **entirely by me** in order to ensure my basic health, safety, and habitability.

This incident signaled a lack of support and responsiveness, forcing me to accept that any similar emergencies—whether sanitary hazards, maintenance failures, or security breaches—would likely be **ignored** or delayed to the point where I would be required to handle them myself, regardless of cost, burden, or legal obligation.

* * *

**Statutory Basis:**

*   **Fla. Stat. § 83.51(2)(a):**  
    "The landlord shall make reasonable provisions for \[...\] running water and hot water."
*   **Fla. Stat. § 83.51(1)(b):**  
    "The landlord shall maintain the plumbing in reasonable working condition."

* * *

**Violation:**  
You violated your statutory duty to maintain essential plumbing facilities in functional condition, leaving me without a sanitary kitchen sink for over **15 days**. This failure was not an isolated lapse but an early indication that tenant needs—no matter how urgent—would be neglected unless handled directly by me.

* * *

**Supporting Evidence:**

*   Text messages documenting my notification of the clogged sink and your lack of response.
*   Follow-up text confirming I completed the repair independently due to your inaction.

* * *

**Conclusion:**  
The January 2024 sink incident exposed the **systemic inadequacy** of your responsiveness as an out-of-state landlord and set a troubling expectation: that any immediate or urgent safety, sanitary, or maintenance issue would be my responsibility, despite Florida law clearly placing this burden on the landlord. The failure to take corrective action, combined with the geographic disconnect, left me to live under the assumption that your neglect was a **requirement of living in your property**, as further evidenced by subsequent failures to address far more serious safety and habitability concerns later in the tenancy.

This incident laid the foundation for the recurring pattern of neglect and delayed communication that would continue to compromise my well-being and safety throughout the lease term.

**Tenant’s Prompt Communication:**  
I promptly reported the issue to you, clearly describing the problem and requesting guidance or repairs. Despite this, you failed to respond or arrange for any professional intervention to address the issue. Instead, I was left without a functioning sink for over two weeks.

**Tenant’s Self-Resolution:**  
After receiving no assistance or acknowledgment of my requests, I was forced to resolve the issue independently by purchasing tools and de-clogging solutions to clear the blockage. Following the repair, I documented my actions and informed you of the resolution via text message. However, there was no response or offer of reimbursement for my time and expenses.

**Pattern of Neglect:**  
This incident set a precedent for how maintenance and safety concerns would be handled during my tenancy. Your delayed responses—or complete lack thereof—indicated that immediate or urgent matters, regardless of their impact on health or habitability, would not receive the necessary support or attention from you. As a result, I was forced to anticipate and address such issues on my own to maintain a basic standard of living in the property.

**Violation of Florida Law:**  
Under **Fla. Stat. §83.51(2)(a)**, you are required to maintain essential facilities, such as plumbing, in working order. By neglecting to respond to a critical issue like this, you violated your statutory obligation to ensure that the property remained habitable and in compliance with health standards. This neglect further demonstrated a disregard for your duty as a landlord to support the tenant’s basic living needs and provide a safe and functional living environment.



### **March 2024: Home Invasion Enabled by Faulty Motion Lights and Deteriorating Gates**

**Incident:**  
On **March 26, 2024**, a **violent home invasion** occurred at approximately 3:00 A.M., facilitated by **deteriorating wooden gates** that could not lock, latch, or close properly, along with **faulty outdoor motion lights** that failed to activate and provide an alert. This terrifying incident required police intervention, culminating in the arrest of the intruder—a man with a documented history of **40 prior arrests, including 9 felonies**.

I immediately notified you of the break-in, provided photographic and police report evidence, and explicitly detailed the critical safety deficiencies that allowed the event to occur. Specifically, I requested:

-   **Repairs or replacement of the wooden side gates** with secure, metal locking gates.
-   **Repairs to faulty motion lights**, which failed to function reliably.

While you verbally acknowledged the deteriorating state of the gates and their need for replacement, you took no action to address these safety failures. Instead, you merely authorized me to install security cameras **at my own expense** under the condition that no drilling into the property would occur. This response was wholly inadequate and failed to meet the safety requirements demanded by law.

***

**Statutory Basis:**

-   **Fla. Stat. § 83.51(1)(a):**  
    "The landlord at all times during the tenancy shall:  
    (a) Comply with the requirements of applicable building, housing, and health codes."
-   **Fla. Stat. § 83.51(2)(a):**  
    "The landlord shall make reasonable provisions for locks and keys."

***

**Violation:**  
Your refusal to address critical safety hazards—gates incapable of locking and faulty motion lights—violated your statutory duty to provide a secure, habitable property. The failure to act after a documented **life-threatening incident**constitutes a reckless disregard for tenant safety.

***f

**Impact on Tenant:**

-   **Physical and Psychological Trauma**: The break-in caused immense fear, exacerbating my **documented PTSD**and leaving me and my family feeling unsafe in the home.
-   **Financial Burden**: I was forced to invest in self-funded security measures (e.g., cameras) to compensate for your neglect of basic safety obligations.
-   **Continued Fear and Anxiety**: Knowing the intruder was familiar with the property and its vulnerabilities heightened my distress. Your failure to act perpetuated an environment of ongoing insecurity.

***

**Supporting Evidence:**

-   Text messages notifying you of the break-in and requesting security improvements.
-   Photos and videos documenting the deteriorating gates and faulty motion lights.
-   Police report detailing the incident and arrest of the intruder.
-   Communications in which you acknowledged the unsafe condition of the gates and motion lights but failed to implement repairs.

***

**Conclusion:**  
The violent home invasion and your subsequent refusal to address safety concerns represent gross negligence and a violation of **Fla. Stat. § 83.51**. You acknowledged the property’s vulnerabilities but deliberately chose to place the financial burden for security improvements on me, the tenant. Your inaction exacerbated the trauma caused by the incident and directly contributed to my emotional distress and financial loss. This incident, coupled with your prior failure to address maintenance concerns, demonstrates a **pattern of willful neglect** and disregard for your legal duties under Florida law.




### **April 2024: Landlord’s On-Site Visit and Continued Neglect of Safety Issues**

During an **April 2024** onsite visit to the property, you, the landlord, physically observed critical safety concerns yet took no action to address them. These included:

-   **Sagging Tree Limbs:** Overhanging branches posed a hazard by hanging dangerously close to outdoor electrical cables above the primary outdoor area.
    
-   **Deteriorated Side Gate Entrance:** The side gate, with no working latch or locks and visibly deteriorating wood, presented a clear security risk. You acknowledged the gate’s condition but did not take steps to repair or secure it.
    
-   **Faulty Motion Lights:** I showed you the non-functional motion lights during your visit, highlighting their failure to provide consistent or reliable illumination. These lights, critical for detecting motion and ensuring safety after the March 2024 home invasion, contributed more to distress with their erratic flickering than to security.
    

**Follow-Up Documentation:**  
Following your visit, I reintroduced the issue of the faulty motion lights via text message and provided a video recording to demonstrate their erratic behavior. Despite this, you failed to respond or take action, ignoring requests to revisit these critical safety concerns and explore your previous mention of installing metal gates to enhance property security.

**Pattern of Neglect:**  
Your failure to address these longstanding safety hazards—despite being physically present on-site, personally observing the issues, and receiving follow-up documentation—exemplifies an ongoing pattern of disregard for tenant safety. This inaction came just weeks after the March 2024 home invasion, further compounding the tenant’s distress and insecurity. Your unwillingness to act directly contravenes your statutory obligations under **Fla. Stat. §83.51**, which require landlords to maintain structural components in good repair and ensure the safety of the property.


**CLAIM: UNLAWFUL OBSTRUCTION OF ACCESS TO PERSONAL PROPERTY AND CONVERSION**

**I. Introduction**

This claim asserts that the landlord, Luther Rollins, has unlawfully obstructed the tenant's access to their personal property, violating Florida Statutes §83.67 and §715.104, and has engaged in the conversion of said property. The landlord's actions include directing his agent to cease communication with the tenant, failing to respond to the tenant's attempts to retrieve their belongings, misrepresenting the tenant's intent, and ultimately converting the tenant's property for his own use. These actions demonstrate a pattern of bad faith and willful disregard for the tenant's rights under Florida law.

**II. Parties**

*   **Claimant (Tenant):** [Your Name]
*   **Respondent (Landlord):** Luther Rollins
*   **Agent (Realtor):** Zach Steinberger

**III. Factual Background**

1.  **Lease Termination:** The lease agreement between the Claimant and Respondent terminated on [Date of Lease Termination].
2.  **Personal Property Left Behind:** Due to storm-related delays, the Claimant left certain personal property on the premises, including a Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill and other items.
3.  **Intent to Retrieve Property:** On September 4, 2024, the Claimant sent a text message to the Respondent stating, "Hi Luther, I’m leaving town tonight indefinitely. It’s the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property. I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank you." This message clearly indicated the Claimant's intent to retrieve their belongings, not to abandon them.
4.  **Landlord's Directive to Cease Communication:** Following the text message, the Respondent instructed his agent, Zach Steinberger, to cease all communication with the Claimant. This directive is evidenced by:
    *   **Text Message from Zach Steinberger:** [Insert the exact text message from Zach Steinberger where he states he was instructed to cease communication].
    *   **Landlord's Instruction:** The landlord's instruction to Zach Steinberger to cease communication is a direct attempt to obstruct the tenant's access to their personal property.
5.  **Tenant's Attempts to Retrieve Property:** The Claimant made multiple written requests to the Respondent, dated September 25, 2024, and September 27, 2024, for access to retrieve their personal property. These requests were ignored by both the Respondent and his agent.
6.  **Misrepresentation of Abandonment:** The Respondent selectively quoted the Claimant's September 4th text message to imply abandonment, misrepresenting the full context and the Claimant's clear intent to retrieve their belongings.
7.  **Conversion of Property:** The Respondent has used the Claimant's personal property, specifically the Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill, to market the rental property as an amenity, demonstrating an unlawful conversion of the Claimant's property.

**IV. Legal Claims**

1.  **Violation of Florida Statute §83.67(2):**
    *   Florida Statute §83.67(2) states, "A landlord of any dwelling unit governed by this part shall not prevent the tenant from gaining reasonable access to the dwelling unit by any means..."
    *   While this section explicitly addresses physical access to the dwelling unit, the overarching principle is the prohibition of any action by the landlord to prevent the tenant from exercising their rights.
    *   The Respondent's directive to cease communication, combined with his failure to respond to the Claimant's requests, effectively prevented the Claimant from gaining reasonable access to their personal property.
    *   The Respondent's actions constitute a violation of the spirit and intent of §83.67, as they actively obstructed the Claimant's right to retrieve their belongings.
2.  **Violation of Florida Statute §715.104:**
    *   Florida Statute §715.104(1) states, "After taking possession of the premises... the landlord shall give written notice to the former tenant... stating that the property is considered abandoned and that the landlord intends to dispose of it if not claimed."
    *   The Respondent failed to provide the Claimant with the required written notice regarding their personal property.
    *   The Respondent's failure to respond to the Claimant's requests for retrieval further demonstrates a violation of this statute.
    *   The Respondent's actions demonstrate a clear disregard for the legally mandated procedures concerning the handling of a tenant's abandoned personal property.
3.  **Conversion of Personal Property:**
    *   The Respondent's use of the Claimant's Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill to market the rental property constitutes conversion, which is the unauthorized use and control of another's property inconsistent with their ownership rights.
    *   The Respondent exercised dominion over the Claimant's belongings in a manner that is inconsistent with the Claimant's ownership rights.
    *   The Respondent's actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for the Claimant's ownership and a clear intent to benefit from the Claimant's property without their consent.
4.  **Bad Faith and Coercive Communication:**
    *   The Respondent's repeated phone calls and text messages urging the Claimant to engage in a phone call, despite the Claimant's explicit request for written communication, constitute harassment and an attempt to coerce the Claimant into abandoning their rights.
    *   The Respondent's misrepresentation of the legal process, implying that the Claimant was legally required to engage in verbal communication, is another attempt to circumvent the Claimant's rights.
    *   The Respondent's actions, especially his knowledge of the Claimant's PTSD, indicate an intentional disregard for the Claimant's rights, suggesting bad faith.

**V. Damages**

As a direct result of the Respondent's unlawful actions, the Claimant is entitled to the following damages:

1.  **Full Return of Security Deposit:** $4,500.00
2.  **Value of Personal Property:** $4,210.62 (value of personal property, including the Weber grill, minus any applicable depreciation)
3.  **Statutory Damages:** Three months' rent, as provided by §715.109, totaling $13,500.00
4.  **Punitive Damages:** To be determined by the court, based on the Respondent's willful and malicious conduct.
5.  **Emotional Distress Damages:** To be determined by the court, based on the Respondent's actions exacerbating the Claimant's PTSD.
6.  **Attorney's Fees and Costs:** As provided by Florida law, if the court finds the Respondent's actions were willful or malicious.

**VI. Conclusion**

The Respondent's actions clearly constitute a violation of the Claimant's rights, including an obstruction of access to their personal property, a failure to follow the proper procedures for handling abandoned property, a misrepresentation of the Claimant's intent, and the conversion of the Claimant's property. The Respondent's directive to cease communication, combined with his failure to respond to the Claimant's requests, and the coercive communication tactics all strengthen the Claimant's legal claims. Given the extent of these violations, the Claimant is well-positioned to seek significant damages.

**VII. Demand**

The Claimant demands that the Respondent immediately:

1.  Return the full security deposit of $4,500.00.
2.  Compensate the Claimant for the full value of their personal property, totaling $4,210.62.
3.  Pay statutory damages of $13,500.00, as provided by §715.109. (Plus Pet Deposit of $500 = $14,000)
4.  Compensate the Claimant for punitive damages, emotional distress damages, attorney's fees, and court costs.

The Claimant is prepared to pursue all available legal remedies to ensure that their rights are protected and that the Respondent is held accountable for their unlawful actions.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: IMPROPER NOTICE
	•	Rollins failed to provide a legally compliant “Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit” as required by Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a). The notice lacked specific itemization, detailed reasons for deductions, and supporting documentation, such as receipts or photos. The use of vague language like “damage to walls” and “missing items” without specifics renders the notice insufficient.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: INCORRECT ADDRESS
	•	The notice included an incorrect zip code for the response address, delaying the tenant’s ability to respond within the statutory timeframe.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: FAILURE TO DISCLOSE
	•	Rollins failed to disclose the financial institution holding the security deposit, whether it was interest-bearing, or if he owns over five properties in Florida as required by law.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: UNLAWFUL DEDUCTIONS
	•	Rollins attempted to use future expenses and speculative damages as a basis for security deposit deductions, which is not permitted under Florida law. He also failed to provide a detailed breakdown of individual costs, making it impossible to determine if amounts claimed were reasonable.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: WITHHOLDING WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION
	•	Rollins withheld the entire security deposit of $4,500 without providing proper justification or evidence of damage.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE IN SUBSEQUENT LETTERS
	•	Despite claiming in his second letter that he has ample photos, witnesses, and documentation to support his claims, Rollins again failed to produce any such evidence. Even after being given a second opportunity to supply detailed information, he did not present the necessary proof, suggesting bad faith and an unwillingness to be transparent.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: FAILURE TO PROVIDE NOTICE
	•	Rollins did not provide the required written notice to the tenant regarding personal property left behind, violating Fla. Stat. §715.104. He failed to specify the items left behind and offer a reasonable timeframe for retrieval.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: CONVERSION OF PROPERTY
	•	Rollins unlawfully retained the tenant’s personal property, including a Weber grill, and used it to market the rental property, which constitutes conversion under Florida law.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: SHIFTING BURDEN OF PROOF
	•	Rollins attempted to shift the burden of proof to the tenant by requesting evidence that the tenant’s personal property was left on the premises, when the burden is on the landlord to prove that the property was not there or that it was abandoned.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: MISREPRESENTATION OF ABANDONMENT
	•	Rollins used a partial quote of a text message to suggest the tenant abandoned the property, which is a misrepresentation and omission of the full context.

LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PREMISES
	•	Rollins neglected maintenance issues, such as a severely clogged kitchen sink, despite being notified. This forced the tenant to resolve the issue himself.

LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO ADDRESS SECURITY CONCERNS
	•	Rollins failed to address security concerns after a break-in, despite the tenant’s requests for improved gates and security cameras. He acknowledged the need for a secure gate but then reversed his commitment. He also limited the tenant’s ability to install security cameras.

LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY
	•	By failing to address the security concerns and maintenance issues, Rollins breached the implied warranty of habitability under Fla. Stat. §83.51.

LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT: UNWANTED COMMUNICATION
	•	Rollins engaged in frequent unsolicited communications, including phone calls and text messages, after being asked to communicate only through certified mail, which constitutes harassment. This disregard for the tenant’s request and the use of unsolicited phone calls exacerbated the tenant’s PTSD.

LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT: MISREPRESENTATION OF LEGAL PROCESS
	•	Rollins attempted to coerce the tenant into a phone call by implying the law requires them to be amicable, which is false.

LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT: EMOTIONAL DISTRESS
	•	Rollins’ actions caused significant emotional distress to the tenant, exacerbating his pre-existing PTSD.

PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT & ETHICAL VIOLATIONS: MISREPRESENTATION AS A LAWYER
	•	Rollins’ use of the email address “luther2law@gmail.com” implies he is acting as a lawyer in this matter, potentially constituting misrepresentation. This could be an attempt to shield himself from scrutiny while retaining the benefits of appearing to be a lawyer.

PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT & ETHICAL VIOLATIONS: VIOLATIONS OF FLORIDA BAR RULES
	•	As an attorney, Rollins’ actions may violate the Florida Bar Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rule 4-8.4(c) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty or misrepresentation) and Rule 4-8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).

LACK OF TRANSPARENCY & BAD FAITH: FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE
	•	Despite claiming to possess photos, receipts, and witness accounts, Rollins failed to provide any supporting documentation to substantiate his claims, even after multiple opportunities.

LACK OF TRANSPARENCY & BAD FAITH: ARBITRARY SETTLEMENT OFFER
	•	Rollins made an arbitrary settlement offer of $2,000, which lacks any legal basis and does not address the full extent of his liabilities.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: DAMAGE TO WALLS
	•	The landlord claims damage to walls without specifying the nature, location, or extent of the damage. The tenant denies causing any damage beyond normal wear and tear, which tenants are not responsible for under Florida law.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: REMOVAL OF FIXTURES
	•	The landlord claims the tenant removed wood cabinets, shelving, and counters without prior written consent. The tenant acknowledges removing temporary fixtures installed for organization but was prepared to restore the premises or compensate, but his attempts to communicate were ignored.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: EXCESSIVE GARBAGE
	•	The landlord claims there was excessive garbage and trash left on the premises. The tenant explains that any trash was due to a delay in garbage collection caused by a severe storm and that all trash was placed in the designated area.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: SPOILED FOOD
	•	The landlord claims spoiled food was left in the refrigerator. The tenant responds that any remaining food items were minimal and did not cause damage and that minor cleaning is considered normal turnover.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: MISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS
	•	The landlord alleges missing and damaged artwork, furnishings, and housewares. However, this claim is unenforceable due to the lack of an initial, detailed inventory list.

ALLEGED ABANDONMENT OF PROPERTY: MISREPRESENTATION OF TEXT MESSAGE
	•	The landlord attempts to mischaracterize a text message from the tenant as an indication that he had abandoned his personal property, but the tenant’s response clarifies the full context of the message, showing intent to retrieve his belongings.

FAILURE TO MAKE REPAIRS: TENANT’S PROACTIVE ACTIONS
	•	The tenant is accused of not making necessary repairs to the property. However, the tenant was forced to take on these repairs due to the landlord’s negligence in the first place, such as the clogged sink, making him justifiably responsible for some issues that would have been the landlord’s responsibility if he had acted proactively.

LANDLORD VIOLATION OF STATUTE 83.67
	•	Landlords are prohibited from converting tenant property for personal use or failing to notify tenants in writing about the status of abandoned personal property. Rollins’ actions are in direct violation of this statute.

LANDLORD VIOLATION OF STATUTE 715.109
	•	A landlord who does not comply with this part shall be liable to the former tenant for actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and costs of the action.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: VAGUE AND LACKING
	•	The landlord’s original claim on the security deposit was vague, lacked itemized specifics, failed to include photographic evidence, and provided an incorrect ZIP Code, causing delivery delays.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: USE OF FUTURE TENSE
	•	The landlord’s notice uses speculative language about future costs and implies that repairs will be necessary. Florida law requires landlords to provide actual costs incurred, not speculative future expenses.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: ABSENCE OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
	•	The landlord’s notice fails to include any supporting documentation such as photographs, receipts, or invoices to substantiate the claims.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: NO BASELINE FOR COMPARISON
	•	Without an initial, itemized inventory, it is impossible to substantiate claims of missing or damaged items. There is no baseline against which to compare the condition of the property at the end of the tenancy.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: UNREASONABLE ACCOUNTABILITY
	•	Holding the tenant accountable for items that were never clearly defined or documented at the start of the tenancy is unreasonable and potentially unlawful.

However, the tenant was forced to take on these repairs due to the landlord’s negligence in the first place, such as the clogged sink, making him justifiably responsible for some issues with the property which would have been the landlord’s responsibility if he was a proactive owner, and not an absentee landlord [3, 4, 9, 13, 18, 20, 22].
landlord violation of statute 83.67 - Landlords are prohibited from converting tenant property for personal use or failing to notify tenants in writing about the status of abandoned personal property [31].

- **FAILURE TO DISCLOSE:**
  - Rollins failed to disclose the financial institution holding the security deposit, whether it was interest-bearing, or whether he owns five or more properties, as required by Fla. Stat. §83.49.

- **UNLAWFUL DEDUCTIONS:**
  - Rollins attempted to rely on future, speculative expenses as a basis for withholding the deposit, contrary to Florida law.
  - He did not provide a detailed breakdown of costs, preventing assessment of reasonableness.

  - Legally, the landlord must prove compliance with notice requirements before treating property as abandoned or converting it.

- **MISREPRESENTATION OF ABANDONMENT:**
  - Rollins selectively quoted a text message to imply the tenant abandoned personal property.
  - The full context shows the tenant intended to reclaim belongings, making the landlord’s representation misleading.

  - Rollins ignored maintenance issues such as a severely clogged kitchen sink.
  - The tenant had to fix it himself due to the landlord’s inaction.

  - Rollins is a licensed attorney in North Carolina, not Florida, where this legal issue is taking place.

- **VIOLATIONS OF FLORIDA BAR RULES:**
  - As an attorney, Rollins’ conduct may violate Rule 4-8.4(c) (prohibiting dishonesty, fraud, deceit, misrepresentation) and Rule 4-8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to justice).

### LACK OF TRANSPARENCY & BAD FAITH:

  - Landlord mentions spoiled food in the refrigerator.
  - Tenant clarifies minimal items were left, not causing damage, and minor cleaning is part of normal turnover.

- **MISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS:**

  - With no initial inventory provided, such claims lack a baseline, making them unenforceable.

### ALLEGED ABANDONMENT OF PROPERTY:

- **MISREPRESENTATION OF TEXT MESSAGE:**
  - Landlord tries to paint a text message as abandonment of property.
  - Full context shows the tenant intended retrieval, not abandonment.

### FAILURE TO MAKE REPAIRS:

- **TENANT’S PROACTIVE ACTIONS:**
  - The tenant took on repairs (like unclogging the sink) only because Rollins ignored the tenant’s maintenance requests.
  - The tenant’s forced role in maintenance underscores the landlord’s negligence.

- **NO BASELINE FOR COMPARISON:**
  - Without an initial, itemized inventory list, any claim of missing or damaged items fails.

-------

**Key Highlights:**

- **Legal Violations:** Multiple claims reference specific Florida statutes (e.g., Fla. Stat. §83.49, Fla. Stat. §715.104, Fla. Stat. §83.51), underscoring the legal basis for each allegation against Rollins.

- **Pattern of Negligence and Misconduct:** The repeated failures in communication, maintenance, and ethical conduct indicate a consistent pattern of negligence and possible intentional misconduct.

- **Misrepresentation as a Lawyer:**
  - **License Jurisdiction Issue:** Rollins is a licensed attorney in North Carolina, not Florida. Using an email address like “luther2law@gmail.com” in a Florida legal matter may mislead the tenant into believing he is authorized to practice law in Florida, potentially violating professional conduct standards.
  - **Intimidation Tactics:** By implying legal expertise or representation through his email and communications, Rollins may be engaging in unethical behavior aimed at intimidating or misleading the tenant, thereby exerting undue pressure during the dispute.

- **Evidence and Documentation Issues:** The lack of proper documentation and evidence from Rollins severely undermines his claims, providing a stronger position for the tenant in any legal proceedings.

- **Emotional and Physical Impact:** Claims related to harassment and emotional distress highlight the adverse effects of Rollins’ actions on the tenant’s well-being, potentially justifying claims for emotional damages.

- **Professional Ethical Concerns:** As an attorney, Rollins’ alleged violations of the Florida Bar Rules amplify the severity of his misconduct, possibly leading to professional disciplinary actions in addition to tenant claims.

1. General Denial & Self-Characterization by Landlord

Landlord’s Claim: States disagreement with allegations, and asserts having acted lawfully, with “kindness” and “professionalism.”

Landlord's Quote: “I disagree with and deny all your allegations… I always treated you with kindness, empathy, professionalism, and regard for the law.”
• Law: Under Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 83.51, the landlord must strictly follow statutory requirements for deposit handling, notice, and habitability—personal opinions do not override these mandates.

• Fact: Despite claims of professionalism, the landlord failed to provide timely, itemized documentation for withholding the security deposit and did not address key maintenance and security issues during the tenancy.

• Conclusion: Subjective self-assessments do not nullify legal obligations. The landlord’s noncompliance with statutory duties exposes them to liability for the full disputed amount ($8,710.62) plus potential enhanced damages.

2. Emotional Appeal & Surprise at the Dispute

Landlord’s Claim: Expresses disappointment and surprise at the dispute.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3) requires a detailed, timely response by the landlord regardless of personal feelings.
• Fact: The landlord did not meet statutory obligations for itemization and timely communication. Emotional surprise does not relieve a landlord from complying with Florida law.
• Conclusion: Personal disappointment is irrelevant. By failing to properly document claims, the landlord faces potential treble damages and punitive damages if they continue to refuse compliance.

3. Allegation of Inaccuracy or Exaggeration

Landlord’s Claim: Suggests tenant’s statements are inaccurate or exaggerated.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) obligates the landlord to present itemized, timely evidence of damage. Without compliance, the landlord’s denials are legally insufficient.
• Fact: The landlord offered no itemized receipts, invoices, or before-and-after photographs within the statutory timeframe.
• Conclusion: Courts, such as in Johnson v. Baker, rule against landlords who cannot substantiate claims. Without timely evidence, withholding the deposit is unlawful, making the landlord liable for the full amount and potential additional damages.

4. Signed Lease Existence

Landlord’s Claim: References having the signed lease.
• Law: A signed lease does not exempt the landlord from meeting Fla. Stat. §§83.49, 83.51 (habitable condition, proper deposit handling), and §§715.10–715.111 (personal property rights).
• Fact: Regardless of the lease, the landlord must still provide timely notice and adhere to statutory mandates for deposit returns and personal property handling.
• Conclusion: Possessing the lease is irrelevant to the landlord’s statutory noncompliance, reinforcing tenant’s right to a full refund and additional remedies.

5. Inventory List Signed by Melissa

Landlord’s Claim: States having an inventory signed by Melissa.
• Law: Johnson v. Baker and Fla. Stat. §83.49(3) require a properly executed, itemized inventory from the outset. Without it, the landlord cannot prove which items were damaged or missing at move-out.
• Fact: No such mutually agreed-upon, properly integrated inventory was provided at move-in. Any post-hoc claim is untimely and legally ineffective.
• Conclusion: Without a recognized inventory baseline, the landlord cannot prove damages or missing items. The time to produce such evidence is past, negating their claim.

6. Photos and Evidence Claims

Landlord’s Claim: Asserts having photos of the premises before and after.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) demands timely, itemized evidence. Landlords who fail to produce contemporaneous documentation for damages cannot later justify deposit withholding.
• Fact: The landlord did not provide these photos with the initial claim, missing the statutory deadline.
• Conclusion: Without timely disclosure, any newly mentioned evidence is legally void. The landlord’s failure to comply exposes them to owing the full amount plus statutory penalties.

7. Witnesses to Condition & Alleged Negligence

Landlord’s Claim: Says witnesses can testify to the condition and negligence.
• Law: Florida courts require timely, credible, and properly presented evidence. Generic witness claims, without sworn statements or affidavits produced at the proper time, have no legal weight.
• Fact: No sworn statements or affidavits were provided during the statutory timeframe.
• Conclusion: Unverified witness references do not cure the landlord’s procedural failures. They remain liable for return of the full deposit and other damages.

8. Receipts for Alleged Damaged Items & Garbage Removal

Landlord’s Claim: Has receipts for removal of damaged items or trash.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) requires these receipts be provided within the initial claim period.
• Fact: The landlord failed to include these receipts at the time of the original deposit claim.
• Conclusion: Attempting to justify withholding after the fact is legally impermissible. The landlord’s noncompliance solidifies the tenant’s claim.

9. Texts Allegedly Contradicting Tenant’s Claims

Landlord’s Claim: Possesses texts from tenant contradicting their claims.
• Law: All relevant evidence must be disclosed and itemized per Fla. Stat. §83.49(3). The landlord cannot surprise the tenant later with undisclosed texts.
• Fact: No such texts were provided timely. The tenant’s communications consistently show attempts to maintain and retrieve personal property lawfully.
• Conclusion: Undisclosed texts are legally irrelevant now. The landlord’s failure to produce them earlier forfeits their evidentiary value.

10. September 4th Text About Leaving Town

Landlord’s Claim: Misquotes tenant’s message to imply abandonment.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §715.104 mandates that the landlord issue written notice before considering property abandoned.
• Fact: The landlord never provided the required abandonment notice. The tenant’s full text shows intent to retrieve belongings, not abandon them.
• Conclusion: Selective quoting is bad faith. By ignoring statutory abandonment procedures, the landlord risks treble damages and punitive damages.

11. Phone Records & No Calls Argument

Landlord’s Claim: States tenant never called to retrieve property.
• Law: Florida statutes rely on written notice and proper documentation, not phone calls.
• Fact: The tenant repeatedly made written requests for retrieving personal property, which the landlord ignored.
• Conclusion: Phone logs are immaterial. The landlord’s disregard for written requests and statutory obligations cements their liability.

12. Uncertainty About Personal Property & Alleged Delivery After Lease

Landlord’s Claim: Cannot confirm property presence, denies conversion.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §§715.10–715.111 require landlords to issue a written notice and allow tenants to recover possessions. Marketing tenant’s items as amenities constitutes conversion.
• Fact: The landlord failed to provide required abandonment notices and used tenant’s grill for the rental listing.
• Conclusion: Uncertainty does not excuse conversion. Unauthorized use of tenant’s property may result in treble damages, punitive damages, and compensation for emotional distress.

13. Counteroffer of 500 for Personal Property

Landlord’s Offer: Proposes 1,500 deposit + 
§
4,500 deposit plus 8,710.62), tenant will pursue maximum damages in court, including treble and punitive damages.

14. Willingness to Talk or Mediate

Landlord’s Claim: Suggests informal settlement or mediation.
• Law: Landlord must first comply with Fla. Stat. §§83.49, 83.51, and 715.10–715.111 before proposing resolution.
• Fact: The landlord’s repeated noncompliance and failure to meet basic statutory requirements negates the need for further informal discussions.
• Conclusion: Without immediate full payment, there is no basis for mediation. Continued refusal triggers litigation and pursuit of full statutory remedies.

15. Impact of Hurricanes & Personal Circumstances

Landlord’s Claim: References hurricane impacts and personal challenges.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §§83.49, 83.51, 715.10–715.111 do not provide exceptions for hardship. Statutory deadlines and requirements remain binding.
• Fact: The landlord never sought extensions or provided explanations at the time compliance was due.
• Conclusion: External factors do not excuse statutory breaches. The landlord remains fully liable for the full amount plus any enhanced damages.

Final Demand and Deadline

After reviewing all claims:
• The landlord repeatedly failed to provide timely, itemized evidence or comply with abandonment procedures.
• The tenant seeks full compensation: $8,710.62 (security deposit + personal property).
• Noncompliance exposes the landlord to treble damages under Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 715.104, plus punitive damages for willful misconduct and emotional distress compensation.
• Provide a 15-day deadline from receipt of this final communication to pay the full amount.
• If payment is not received, the tenant will proceed to circuit court and seek maximum allowable damages.

General Denial & Self-Characterization
Landlord’s Claim: “I disagree with and deny all your allegations… I always treated you with kindness, empathy, professionalism, and regard for the law.”

Law: Under Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 83.51, a landlord’s legal responsibilities are objective and not subject to personal interpretation. The law mandates proper handling of security deposits, timely notice, safe housing conditions, and adherence to statutory procedures for any personal property left behind. Your subjective view of your behavior cannot override these statutory directives

Fact: Despite your claim of kindness and professionalism, you failed to provide an itemized statement of deductions from the security deposit within the statutory timeframe, did not ensure proper safety and habitability measures after a documented break-in, and neglected to follow the procedures required by Fla. Stat. §§715.10–715.111 regarding abandoned or unclaimed personal property. Your failure to meet these objective legal criteria is well-documented and not mitigated by any personal sentiment.

Conclusion: Your personal feelings and self-assessment do not exempt you from meeting rigid statutory obligations. Florida law is clear and unambiguous: you must comply with the statutes governing deposit returns, maintenance, and personal property handling. Having not done so, your claim of “regard for the law” collapses under the weight of your demonstrable noncompliance. No amount of subjective “kindness” changes these objective legal failures.

Emotional Appeal & Surprise at the Dispute
Landlord’s Claim: “I never imagined that our relationship would end in any sort of dispute… surprised, disappointed, and somewhat disheartened.”

Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3) mandates strict compliance with notice and documentation requirements related to security deposits, and Fla. Stat. §83.51 addresses the landlord’s duty to maintain a habitable property. Surprise or disappointment does not alter or delay these legal imperatives.

Fact: You were legally required to provide prompt, itemized justifications for any deposit withholding at the conclusion of the tenancy. You did not. You were required to maintain the property in a safe and habitable condition, including addressing known security risks post-break-in. You failed. These are statutory duties that do not vanish simply because you did not anticipate a conflict.

Conclusion: Your emotional response is immaterial. Statutory obligations persist regardless of your expectations or personal feelings. The dispute arose because you did not adhere to the specific legal steps required, not because I unfairly sought a confrontation. Under Florida law, the landlord’s compliance or noncompliance determines outcomes, not emotional sentiments.

Allegation of Inaccuracy or Exaggeration
Landlord’s Claim: “Much of what you say is not accurate and/or exaggerated.”

Law: Under Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a), a landlord must provide an itemized list of damages claimed against the deposit within the statutory timeframe, accompanied by supporting evidence. Without timely, concrete evidence, the landlord’s withholding is presumptively unlawful.

Fact: You have not presented timely, itemized evidence. Instead of addressing the specific factual inaccuracies you allege, you rely on vague denials without producing the statutorily required documentation (e.g., detailed receipts, properly executed inventories, time-stamped photographs). Your general claim of “inaccuracy” thus stands unsupported and legally insufficient.

Conclusion: In the absence of timely, legally compliant evidence, the law defaults to protecting the tenant’s deposit. Calling my claims inaccurate without furnishing the requisite proof at the required time fails to meet the legal standard Florida law imposes. Your credibility and position erode further each time you invoke unsupported allegations of exaggeration without the documentation the statutes demand.

Signed Lease
Landlord’s Claim: “I have a copy of the written lease signed by you.”

Law: While the lease establishes our contractual relationship, Fla. Stat. §§83.49, 83.51, and §§715.10–715.111 impose statutory duties separate from lease terms. No clause in the lease can diminish or negate these statutory obligations.

Fact: Possession of a signed lease merely confirms we had a landlord-tenant relationship. It does not justify withholding the deposit without following statutory processes or failing to provide the maintenance and safety measures required by law. Nor does it excuse your failure to follow the formal procedures outlined in the statutes governing personal property retrieval.

Conclusion: The existence of a signed lease is not a shield against statutory noncompliance. It does not nullify your obligation to send proper notices, itemized breakdowns, and comply with security and maintenance standards. By failing to meet these duties, you remain in violation of Florida law, regardless of having a signed lease in hand.

Inventory List Signed by Melissa
Landlord’s Claim: “I have a copy of the inventory signed by Melissa when you moved in.”
__
Law: Pursuant to Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) and case law such as Johnson v. Baker, a landlord must establish a verified baseline condition of the property to justify later damage claims. Such an inventory must be properly executed, fully acknowledged by all parties (including both tenants), and integrated into the lease at the outset.

Fact: I never reviewed, signed, or agreed to any inventory list, and it was never attached as a mutually acknowledged lease addendum. You have not shown that this alleged inventory was lawfully incorporated at move-in, nor provided at any appropriate point to establish a baseline for damage claims. Without my signature and the proper formalization, the alleged inventory list fails to meet the evidentiary standards Florida law requires for damage justification.

Conclusion: An alleged inventory that was never fully executed by all parties and never integrated into the lease documents at the appropriate time is legally meaningless. Without a legitimate, verified baseline condition documented at move-in, you cannot credibly assert tenant-caused damages later. Any claim based on this alleged inventory is legally void.

I am not offering another informal chance for you to fix this evidentiary gap. Either promptly pay the full $8,710.62 owed or face the consequences in circuit court, where the burden of your statutory failures may be met with treble and punitive damages.

Photos and Evidence Claims
Landlord’s Claim: “I have photos of the premises before and after…”

Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) demands timely, itemized evidence accompanying the initial deposit claim. Merely claiming to have photos after-the-fact is legally insufficient.

Fact: If these photos genuinely showed tenant-caused damage, you should have presented them immediately during the statutory notice period, not long after. Your failure to do so when legally required to proves these alleged images cannot retroactively justify deposit deductions. They do not meet the stringent procedural and evidentiary requirements established by Florida law.

Conclusion: Late claims of possessing photographic evidence carry no legal weight. You missed the statutory window to present them as part of a valid, itemized damages statement. Without adherence to procedural timelines, such evidence is now rendered moot, leaving your withholding of the deposit unsupported and unlawful.

Witnesses to Condition & Alleged Negligence
Landlord’s Claim: “I have witnesses to the condition… witnesses to your negligent treatment…”

Law: Florida courts require objective, contemporaneous evidence that aligns with statutory requirements, not vague witness references. Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) places the onus on you to timely and properly document damages.

Fact: You have not named these witnesses, produced sworn affidavits, or shown how their testimony corroborates a properly itemized and timely damage claim. Without official statements tied to statutory notice requirements, unnamed witness claims fail as legitimate evidence.

Conclusion: Unspecified witnesses cannot remedy statutory noncompliance. The legal process demands documented, timely, and admissible evidence. Vague mentions of witnesses do not salvage your case from the statutory failures you have already committed.

Receipts for Alleged Damaged Items & Garbage Removal
Landlord’s Claim: “I have receipts for removal of excessively damaged items…”

Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) mandates that landlords provide itemized costs and supporting documentation within the legally specified timeframe.

Fact: You never presented these receipts in a timely manner. Attempting to rely on them now violates both the letter and spirit of the statutes designed to protect tenants from after-the-fact justifications. The law does not permit you to produce critical evidence at your convenience; deadlines and procedures exist for a reason.

Conclusion: Your belated mention of receipts is irrelevant. You forfeited the legal right to use such evidence by not disclosing it at the required time. Absent timely compliance, you cannot retroactively legitimize your deductions.

Texts Allegedly Contradicting My Claims
Landlord’s Claim: “I have texts from you that contradict your Response claims.”

Law: Under Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a), you must promptly provide documentation that justifies withholding my deposit. You must also comply with Fla. Stat. §715.104 for personal property handling.

Fact: If these texts were genuinely exculpatory or indicative of tenant abandonment, you should have included them in your initial claim or promptly upon disputing my demands. Instead, you merely assert their existence without producing them as timely evidence.

Conclusion: Late, unverified claims about having contradictory texts hold no weight. Courts and statutes require immediate and transparent evidence. Without producing such texts in a legally compliant manner, you fail to refute my claims or justify your actions, leaving your position legally indefensible.

September 4th Text About Leaving Town (Partial Quotation)
Landlord’s Claim: “I have your Sept. 4th pm text… ‘leaving town… indefinitely’”

Law: Fla. Stat. §715.104 requires you to provide proper written notice and an opportunity for retrieval before treating property as abandoned.

Fact: You selectively quoted my text to imply I abandoned my property. The full text states: “Hi Luther, I’m leaving town tonight indefinitely. It’s the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property. I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank you.” In context, this message reaffirms my intent to retrieve my possessions, not abandon them. My documented efforts to reclaim items refute any claim of abandonment.

Conclusion: By quoting only part of my text to distort its meaning, you demonstrate bad faith and further undermine your credibility. A lawful abandonment determination requires statutory notice and a reasonable retrieval period, none of which you provided. Misrepresenting my communications does not erase your statutory failures; it only reinforces them.

Phone Records & No Calls Argument
Landlord’s Claim: “I have phone records that show you never called me…”

Law: Florida’s landlord-tenant statutes do not demand phone calls as the method of communication for deposit disputes or personal property retrieval. Written documentation is the legally preferred standard of evidence.

Fact: I relied on written requests—emails, letters, texts—creating a clear legal record. The law does not hinge upon phone calls. Your emphasis on calls that never occurred is a distraction from your failure to respond to the written communications that Florida law deems more definitive and enforceable.

Conclusion: The absence of phone calls is irrelevant. Legally, what matters is your response to my documented written requests, which you ignored. Since Florida statutes prioritize transparent, written notice and disclosure, your argument that I never called does nothing to justify your continued statutory noncompliance or withholding of my property.

Uncertainty About Personal Property & Alleged Delivery After Lease
Landlord’s Claim: “I cannot confirm or deny… I have not converted or sold any personal property…”

Law: Fla. Stat. §§715.10–715.111 outline the procedures you must follow before disposing of or converting tenant property, including giving proper notice and allowing a retrieval window.

Fact: Your inability to confirm property presence does not excuse failing to send the legally required notices. Advertising items like my grill as rental amenities strongly suggests you have retained and used my property for your benefit. You never provided any statutory notice of abandonment or followed the protocol for handling property as required by the statutes.

Conclusion: Uncertainty is no defense under Florida law. By ignoring the statutory process and benefiting from my property, you have effectively converted it. This wrongful conversion could expose you to treble damages and punitive damages in circuit court. Without strict compliance, your actions stand as unlawful appropriation of tenant-owned property.

Your 500 Property Counteroffer
Landlord’s Claim: “I propose… 500 for personal property… no further litigation.”

Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49 and related statutes uphold the tenant’s right to full deposit return absent properly documented deductions. Similarly, Fla. Stat. §§715.10–715.111 support full tenant rights over personal property unless the landlord follows legal disposal procedures.

Fact: My claims total 4,500 security deposit and $4,210.62 in personal property value. Your minimal offer fails to acknowledge your statutory noncompliance and the fact that no legitimate evidence supports withholding or converting my property. Courts have historically penalized landlords who fail to meet these evidentiary and procedural requirements, potentially awarding treble, punitive, and emotional distress damages.

Conclusion: Your offer is legally insufficient and financially insulting given the documented statutory violations. No partial measures or meager settlements will be entertained. You have forfeited informal remedy opportunities by refusing to comply with Florida law. The only acceptable path to avoiding litigation and severe legal consequences is immediate payment of the full $8,710.62.

Willingness to Talk or Mediate
Landlord’s Claim: “We need to talk… I am willing to attend mediation or other expedited dispute resolution.”

Law: Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 715.104 do not require me to engage in verbal negotiations after you have failed to meet statutory deadlines and documentary requirements. Mediation is an option, but it does not excuse prior noncompliance.

Fact: I have relied on written communications, as Florida law heavily favors clear, documented channels to establish a transparent record of compliance or noncompliance. You ignored these, missing your statutory windows, and now offer mediation only after the fact. Without adherence to legal obligations at the appropriate times, talk of mediation is too little, too late.

Conclusion: Your sudden openness to mediated discussions cannot reverse your missed deadlines or rectify the absence of legally required disclosures. Any hope of informal resolution has passed. Now, only immediate, full payment of $8,710.62 can avert circuit court proceedings, where you face treble damages, punitive damages, and other severe legal and financial repercussions.


• The lease explicitly identifies Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk as landlords, omitting Amarlu Enterprises or any associated assumed business names (Amarlu Enterprises, Amarlu Company, Amarlu Consulting).

Payment Instructions:
• Tenants were provided with ten (10) pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes at move-in, directing payments to Amarlu Enterprises at 231 Government Ave 3094, Hickory, NC 28602.

• Despite Amarlu Enterprises collecting rent, it was not disclosed in the lease agreement nor registered to conduct business in Florida.

Amarlu Enterprises and Assumed Business Names:
• Amarlu Enterprises is a North Carolina-registered entity, with assumed business names of Amarlu Enterprises, Amarlu Company, and Amarlu Consulting, filed on July 7, 2023 with the Catawba County Register of Deeds.

• Furthermore, and with critical influence on the outcome of this dispute, Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina entity owned by Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk, is not registered as a foreign entity with the Florida Division of Corporations, violating Florida Statutes § 605.0902. However, this entity is collecting revenue illegally and in the shadows within the State of Florida via rental income.

Evidence Supporting the Tenant’s Case:
• Proof of payments instructed to be made directly to Amarlu Enterprises.

• The lease agreement omits Amarlu Enterprises entirely.

• Instructions to tenants to use pre-stamped envelopes addressed to Amarlu Enterprises.

• Personal property worth $4,200 was withheld by the landlords without legal justification.

• The landlords made a counteroffer of only 1,500 for the security deposit, failing to address the broader legal issues.

Landlord’s Professional Background:
• Luther Rollins is a licensed attorney in good standing with the North Carolina State Bar and holds his license officially with the ** Missouri Bar**, practicing in North Carolina as an out-of-state member. His legal expertise heightens the expectation of compliance with state laws and ethical obligations. This is most critical as it relates to punitive claims against the landlord.

Legal Issues Identified

Failure to Register as a Foreign Entity:
• Florida law requires out-of-state entities like Amarlu Enterprises to register before conducting business in the state.

• By collecting $45,000 in rent without registration, Amarlu Enterprises violated Florida Statutes § 605.0902. Under the law, this immediately renders the lease fully illegal, any dispute for security deposits defaults to the tenants' favor, property value to be restored in full, etc. Further, this could result in civil penalties.

Fraudulent Misrepresentation:
• The lease failed to disclose Amarlu Enterprises, yet tenants were instructed to make payments to this entity.

• Fraudulent misrepresentation arises from this intentional omission, as tenants were deprived of a full understanding of the parties involved in the agreement.

Violation of Florida Landlord-Tenant Laws:
• Florida Statutes § 83.49 requires landlords to return security deposits within 30 days of lease termination or provide an itemized list of deductions if retaining any portion of the security deposit, thus placing a claim on the deposit. Failure to comply can result in the forfeiture of the deposit and statutory penalties. The landlord met this timely obligation by issuing a certified letter on the 30th and final day of the 30-day window from the day the tenant vacated the property.

• Withholding personal property valued at $4,200 violates Florida Statutes § 83.67, which prohibits landlords from unlawfully retaining or disposing of tenants' property.

Ethical and Professional Misconduct:
• As a licensed attorney, Luther Rollins is held to higher ethical standards. His involvement in structuring the lease and payment arrangements in violation of Florida law raises questions about professional misconduct under North Carolina and Missouri bar rules.

Tax Evasion:
• Payments directed to Amarlu Enterprises, an unregistered entity, raise concerns about compliance with Florida and federal tax laws. The lack of registration suggests an attempt to avoid Florida’s tax obligations.

Payment Instructions:
• Upon move-in, tenants were provided with pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes directing all rent payments to Amarlu Enterprises at 231 Government Ave 3094, Hickory, NC 28602.

• Every payment for the full lease term (totaling $45,000) was made to Amarlu Enterprises, despite its omission from the lease agreement.

• This discrepancy between the lease agreement and payment practices forms the basis for allegations of fraud and misrepresentation.

Amarlu Enterprises and Assumed Business Names:
• On July 7, 2023, Rollins and Polk filed documentation with the Catawba County Register of Deeds, certifying that Amarlu Enterprises would operate under three assumed business names:

Amarlu Enterprises.

Amarlu Company.

Amarlu Consulting.

• However, none of these entities or assumed names are registered with the Florida Division of Corporations as required by Florida Statutes § 605.0902, which mandates foreign business registration before conducting business in Florida.

• The use of an unregistered foreign entity to collect rent in Florida constitutes a direct violation of state law.

Personal Property Withheld:
• Upon termination of the lease, the landlords withheld personal property belonging to the tenants, valued at $4,200 after depreciation.

• Florida Statutes § 83.67 prohibits landlords from unlawfully retaining or disposing of tenant property. The withholding of personal items constitutes another legal violation.

Landlords’ Counteroffer:
• In response to initial demands for the return of the withheld property and a portion of the security deposit, the landlords offered:

• $500 for the personal property (far below its depreciated value).

• 4,500 security deposit.

• This counteroffer fails to address the broader legal violations, including fraudulent collection of rent and failure to register Amarlu Enterprises in Florida.

Landlord’s Legal Background:
• Luther Rollins is a licensed attorney in good standing with the North Carolina State Bar and an out-of-state member of the Missouri Bar.

• His legal expertise increases his accountability for ensuring compliance with state laws and ethical practices. Using his professional knowledge to structure lease and payment arrangements that circumvent Florida law raises serious ethical concerns and potential bar violations.

Legal Issues Identified

Violation of Florida Business Registration Laws:
• Florida Statutes § 605.0902 requires foreign entities to register with the Florida Division of Corporations before conducting business in the state.

• Amarlu Enterprises collected rent for a Florida property without registering, making its actions illegal and potentially invalidating the lease agreement.

• Consequences of this violation:

• Amarlu Enterprises cannot enforce any legal claims in Florida courts until it registers as a foreign entity.

• Tenants may seek full restitution of rent payments made to an unregistered entity.

Fraudulent Misrepresentation:
• The landlords failed to disclose Amarlu Enterprises in the lease agreement while directing payments to the entity.

• This deliberate omission constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation, depriving tenants of the opportunity to understand the true parties involved in the lease.

• Fraudulent intent is further evidenced by:

• The use of pre-stamped envelopes addressed to Amarlu Enterprises.

• The landlords’ failure to comply with Florida’s business and tax laws.

Violation of Florida Landlord-Tenant Laws:
• Security Deposit Mishandling:

• Florida Statutes § 83.49 requires landlords to return security deposits within 15 days of lease termination or provide an itemized list of deductions.

• The landlords’ failure to meet these requirements entitles the tenant to the full deposit amount, plus potential penalties for bad faith.


83.50 - Disclosure of Landlord's Address - The LEASE states that the Landlord must list a "landlord address" and certain written permissions are required to be sent to the landlord in writing. The landlord did not list his address in Hickory, NC. Rather, the landlord listed the same address as the leased property in which the lease was being executed for. It could be stated that written permission for any claim such as altering the property was not possible due to the written permissions being executed per the lease and thus the written requests for permission would just end up in the same mailbox that attempted to mail requests to the landlord. this is another example of bad, improper, unethical, sneaky attention to detail.
The landlord address listed is the same address as the leased home address. More bad faith?
• Unlawful Retention of Property:

• Florida Statutes § 83.67 prohibits landlords from withholding or disposing of tenant property. The landlords’ actions in withholding $4,200 worth of personal property violate this statute.

Tax Evasion:
• By funneling rental income through an unregistered entity, the landlords may have failed to report income properly to Florida tax authorities.

• This raises potential tax evasion concerns at both the state and federal levels.

Ethical and Professional Misconduct:
• As a licensed attorney, Rollins is held to higher ethical standards under bar rules in North Carolina and Missouri.

• Structuring a fraudulent lease arrangement to avoid legal and tax obligations could result in disciplinary action from the respective bar associations.

Repetitive, Coercive Communications and Misrepresentation of Legal Requirements**

Your persistent attempts to coerce me into a phone call, despite my clear, written request for all communications to remain in writing, constitute a pattern of harassment—especially given your self-declared status as a “corporate attorney” and the intimidation factor introduced by your “luther2law” email address. Florida’s landlord-tenant statutes do not compel me to engage in phone discussions to resolve disputes or address your claims. Yet you continued to push for verbal contact, misrepresenting that the law requires such a step.

Timeline of Intensive Harassment on October 29, 2024:
Over the course of approximately six hours, you escalated your pressure tactics, placing repeated phone calls and leaving multiple voicemails, each attempt separated by roughly two-hour intervals. After ignoring my standing request for written correspondence, you made two phone calls followed by two voicemails, all within a short timeframe. When I did not respond, you followed up with a text message, again approximately two hours later, thereby punctuating the day with a relentless cycle of unsolicited outreach.

Quoted Text Message Written by Luther Rollins, Landlord:

After these repeated phone contacts and voicemails, you sent me the following text message on October 29, 2024:

“Hi Stephen, I called you a couple times today to discuss the Tenant Response & Dispute you sent to me which I recently received. I hope we could talk (and I believe we are both supposed to) try to resolve amicably. I am available most days this week 9:00am-ish till about 10pm.”

In this message, you again attempt to frame the resolution process as something that supposedly mandates a phone call, stating “I believe we are both supposed to” engage in a verbal discussion. This is categorically untrue. Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 83.51, which govern security deposits and habitability, as well as §§715.10–715.111, which outline procedures for handling personal property, impose no requirement for phone calls, verbal negotiations, or live discussions. Your claim that “we are both supposed to” have a phone call severely misrepresents the law and seeks to corner me into a scenario where I would be at a disadvantage—“outmatched by a declared lawyer”—contrary to the transparency and fairness that the statutes intend.

Impact and Legal Implications:
The repeated calls, voicemails, and now this text message—each separated by roughly two-hour intervals—display a calculated effort to erode my stance on written communication and push me into a verbally intimidating interaction. This calculated timing and insistence on a method never required by statute is a form of harassment. Your decision to leverage your attorney status, along with an email moniker implying legal expertise, only intensifies the coercive atmosphere.

Conclusion:
These actions—excessive calling, repeated voicemails, and sending a misleading text message after a series of two-hour interval attempts—violate the principle of written, verifiable communication that Florida law heavily favors and I explicitly requested. By misrepresenting legal requirements and attempting to pressure me into a “phone call” that statutes do not mandate, you have crossed into harassment and bad-faith intimidation. This coercive behavior will not force me to abandon my legal rights or documented communication channels. Instead, it further solidifies my resolve to seek remedies permitted by Florida law, should you continue to flout statutory directives and proper dispute resolution procedures.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: IMPROPER NOTICE
	•	Rollins failed to provide a legally compliant “Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit” as required by Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a). The notice lacked specific itemization, detailed reasons for deductions, and supporting documentation, such as receipts or photos. The use of vague language like “damage to walls” and “missing items” without specifics renders the notice insufficient.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: INCORRECT ADDRESS
	•	The notice included an incorrect zip code for the response address, delaying the tenant’s ability to respond within the statutory timeframe.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: FAILURE TO DISCLOSE
	•	Rollins failed to disclose the financial institution holding the security deposit, whether it was interest-bearing, or if he owns over five properties in Florida as required by law.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: UNLAWFUL DEDUCTIONS
	•	Rollins attempted to use future expenses and speculative damages as a basis for security deposit deductions, which is not permitted under Florida law. He also failed to provide a detailed breakdown of individual costs, making it impossible to determine if amounts claimed were reasonable.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: WITHHOLDING WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION
	•	Rollins withheld the entire security deposit of $4,500 without providing proper justification or evidence of damage.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE IN SUBSEQUENT LETTERS
	•	Despite claiming in his second letter that he has ample photos, witnesses, and documentation to support his claims, Rollins again failed to produce any such evidence. Even after being given a second opportunity to supply detailed information, he did not present the necessary proof, suggesting bad faith and an unwillingness to be transparent.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: FAILURE TO PROVIDE NOTICE
	•	Rollins did not provide the required written notice to the tenant regarding personal property left behind, violating Fla. Stat. §715.104. He failed to specify the items left behind and offer a reasonable timeframe for retrieval.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: CONVERSION OF PROPERTY
	•	Rollins unlawfully retained the tenant’s personal property, including a Weber grill, and used it to market the rental property, which constitutes conversion under Florida law.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: SHIFTING BURDEN OF PROOF
	•	Rollins attempted to shift the burden of proof to the tenant by requesting evidence that the tenant’s personal property was left on the premises, when the burden is on the landlord to prove that the property was not there or that it was abandoned.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: MISREPRESENTATION OF ABANDONMENT
	•	Rollins used a partial quote of a text message to suggest the tenant abandoned the property, which is a misrepresentation and omission of the full context.

LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PREMISES
	•	Rollins neglected maintenance issues, such as a severely clogged kitchen sink, despite being notified. This forced the tenant to resolve the issue himself.

LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO ADDRESS SECURITY CONCERNS
	•	Rollins failed to address security concerns after a break-in, despite the tenant’s requests for improved gates and security cameras. He acknowledged the need for a secure gate but then reversed his commitment. He also limited the tenant’s ability to install security cameras.

LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY
	•	By failing to address the security concerns and maintenance issues, Rollins breached the implied warranty of habitability under Fla. Stat. §83.51.

LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT: UNWANTED COMMUNICATION
	•	Rollins engaged in frequent unsolicited communications, including phone calls and text messages, after being asked to communicate only through certified mail, which constitutes harassment. This disregard for the tenant’s request and the use of unsolicited phone calls exacerbated the tenant’s PTSD.

LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT: MISREPRESENTATION OF LEGAL PROCESS
	•	Rollins attempted to coerce the tenant into a phone call by implying the law requires them to be amicable, which is false.

LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT: EMOTIONAL DISTRESS
	•	Rollins’ actions caused significant emotional distress to the tenant, exacerbating his pre-existing PTSD.

PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT & ETHICAL VIOLATIONS: MISREPRESENTATION AS A LAWYER
	•	Rollins’ use of the email address “luther2law@gmail.com” implies he is acting as a lawyer in this matter, potentially constituting misrepresentation. This could be an attempt to shield himself from scrutiny while retaining the benefits of appearing to be a lawyer.

PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT & ETHICAL VIOLATIONS: VIOLATIONS OF FLORIDA BAR RULES
	•	As an attorney, Rollins’ actions may violate the Florida Bar Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rule 4-8.4(c) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty or misrepresentation) and Rule 4-8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).

LACK OF TRANSPARENCY & BAD FAITH: FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE
	•	Despite claiming to possess photos, receipts, and witness accounts, Rollins failed to provide any supporting documentation to substantiate his claims, even after multiple opportunities.

LACK OF TRANSPARENCY & BAD FAITH: ARBITRARY SETTLEMENT OFFER
	•	Rollins made an arbitrary settlement offer of $2,000, which lacks any legal basis and does not address the full extent of his liabilities.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: DAMAGE TO WALLS
	•	The landlord claims damage to walls without specifying the nature, location, or extent of the damage. The tenant denies causing any damage beyond normal wear and tear, which tenants are not responsible for under Florida law.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: REMOVAL OF FIXTURES
	•	The landlord claims the tenant removed wood cabinets, shelving, and counters without prior written consent. The tenant acknowledges removing temporary fixtures installed for organization but was prepared to restore the premises or compensate, but his attempts to communicate were ignored.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: EXCESSIVE GARBAGE
	•	The landlord claims there was excessive garbage and trash left on the premises. The tenant explains that any trash was due to a delay in garbage collection caused by a severe storm and that all trash was placed in the designated area.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: SPOILED FOOD
	•	The landlord claims spoiled food was left in the refrigerator. The tenant responds that any remaining food items were minimal and did not cause damage and that minor cleaning is considered normal turnover.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: MISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS
	•	The landlord alleges missing and damaged artwork, furnishings, and housewares. However, this claim is unenforceable due to the lack of an initial, detailed inventory list.

ALLEGED ABANDONMENT OF PROPERTY: MISREPRESENTATION OF TEXT MESSAGE
	•	The landlord attempts to mischaracterize a text message from the tenant as an indication that he had abandoned his personal property, but the tenant’s response clarifies the full context of the message, showing intent to retrieve his belongings.

FAILURE TO MAKE REPAIRS: TENANT’S PROACTIVE ACTIONS
	•	The tenant is accused of not making necessary repairs to the property. However, the tenant was forced to take on these repairs due to the landlord’s negligence in the first place, such as the clogged sink, making him justifiably responsible for some issues that would have been the landlord’s responsibility if he had acted proactively.

LANDLORD VIOLATION OF STATUTE 83.67
	•	Landlords are prohibited from converting tenant property for personal use or failing to notify tenants in writing about the status of abandoned personal property. Rollins’ actions are in direct violation of this statute.

LANDLORD VIOLATION OF STATUTE 715.109
	•	A landlord who does not comply with this part shall be liable to the former tenant for actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and costs of the action.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: VAGUE AND LACKING
	•	The landlord’s original claim on the security deposit was vague, lacked itemized specifics, failed to include photographic evidence, and provided an incorrect ZIP Code, causing delivery delays.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: USE OF FUTURE TENSE
	•	The landlord’s notice uses speculative language about future costs and implies that repairs will be necessary. Florida law requires landlords to provide actual costs incurred, not speculative future expenses.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: ABSENCE OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
	•	The landlord’s notice fails to include any supporting documentation such as photographs, receipts, or invoices to substantiate the claims.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: NO BASELINE FOR COMPARISON
	•	Without an initial, itemized inventory, it is impossible to substantiate claims of missing or damaged items. There is no baseline against which to compare the condition of the property at the end of the tenancy.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: UNREASONABLE ACCOUNTABILITY
	•	Holding the tenant accountable for items that were never clearly defined or documented at the start of the tenancy is unreasonable and potentially unlawful.

- **FAILURE TO DISCLOSE:**
  - Rollins failed to disclose the financial institution holding the security deposit, whether it was interest-bearing, or whether he owns five or more properties, as required by Fla. Stat. §83.49.

- **UNLAWFUL DEDUCTIONS:**

  - Legally, the landlord must prove compliance with notice requirements before treating property as abandoned or converting it.

- **MISREPRESENTATION OF ABANDONMENT:**
  - Rollins selectively quoted a text message to imply the tenant abandoned personal property.
  - The full context shows the tenant intended to reclaim belongings, making the landlord’s representation misleading.

  - Rollins ignored maintenance issues such as a severely clogged kitchen sink.
  - The tenant had to fix it himself due to the landlord’s inaction.

- **VIOLATIONS OF FLORIDA BAR RULES:**
  - As an attorney, Rollins’ conduct may violate Rule 4-8.4(c) (prohibiting dishonesty, fraud, deceit, misrepresentation) and Rule 4-8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to justice).

  - Landlord mentions spoiled food in the refrigerator.
  - Tenant clarifies minimal items were left, not causing damage, and minor cleaning is part of normal turnover.

  - With no initial inventory provided, such claims lack a baseline, making them unenforceable.

### ALLEGED ABANDONMENT OF PROPERTY:

- **MISREPRESENTATION OF TEXT MESSAGE:**
  - Landlord tries to paint a text message as abandonment of property.
  - Full context shows the tenant intended retrieval, not abandonment.

### FAILURE TO MAKE REPAIRS:

  - The tenant’s forced role in maintenance underscores the landlord’s negligence.

-------

**Key Highlights:**

- **Legal Violations:** Multiple claims reference specific Florida statutes (e.g., Fla. Stat. §83.49, Fla. Stat. §715.104, Fla. Stat. §83.51), underscoring the legal basis for each allegation against Rollins.

- **Pattern of Negligence and Misconduct:** The repeated failures in communication, maintenance, and ethical conduct indicate a consistent pattern of negligence and possible intentional misconduct.

- **Misrepresentation as a Lawyer:**
  - **License Jurisdiction Issue:** Rollins is a licensed attorney in North Carolina, not Florida. Using an email address like “luther2law@gmail.com” in a Florida legal matter may mislead the tenant into believing he is authorized to practice law in Florida, potentially violating professional conduct standards.
  - **Intimidation Tactics:** By implying legal expertise or representation through his email and communications, Rollins may be engaging in unethical behavior aimed at intimidating or misleading the tenant, thereby exerting undue pressure during the dispute.

- **Evidence and Documentation Issues:** The lack of proper documentation and evidence from Rollins severely undermines his claims, providing a stronger position for the tenant in any legal proceedings.

- **Emotional and Physical Impact:** Claims related to harassment and emotional distress highlight the adverse effects of Rollins’ actions on the tenant’s well-being, potentially justifying claims for emotional damages.

- **Professional Ethical Concerns:** As an attorney, Rollins’ alleged violations of the Florida Bar Rules amplify the severity of his misconduct, possibly leading to professional disciplinary actions in addition to tenant claims.

1. General Denial & Self-Characterization by Landlord

Landlord’s Claim: States disagreement with allegations, and asserts having acted lawfully, with “kindness” and “professionalism.”

Landlord's Quote: “I disagree with and deny all your allegations… I always treated you with kindness, empathy, professionalism, and regard for the law.”
• Law: Under Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 83.51, the landlord must strictly follow statutory requirements for deposit handling, notice, and habitability—personal opinions do not override these mandates.

• Fact: Despite claims of professionalism, the landlord failed to provide timely, itemized documentation for withholding the security deposit and did not address key maintenance and security issues during the tenancy.

• Conclusion: Subjective self-assessments do not nullify legal obligations. The landlord’s noncompliance with statutory duties exposes them to liability for the full disputed amount ($8,710.62) plus potential enhanced damages.

2. Emotional Appeal & Surprise at the Dispute

Landlord’s Claim: Expresses disappointment and surprise at the dispute.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3) requires a detailed, timely response by the landlord regardless of personal feelings.
• Fact: The landlord did not meet statutory obligations for itemization and timely communication. Emotional surprise does not relieve a landlord from complying with Florida law.
• Conclusion: Personal disappointment is irrelevant. By failing to properly document claims, the landlord faces potential treble damages and punitive damages if they continue to refuse compliance.

3. Allegation of Inaccuracy or Exaggeration

Landlord’s Claim: Suggests tenant’s statements are inaccurate or exaggerated.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) obligates the landlord to present itemized, timely evidence of damage. Without compliance, the landlord’s denials are legally insufficient.
• Fact: The landlord offered no itemized receipts, invoices, or before-and-after photographs within the statutory timeframe.
• Conclusion: Courts, such as in Johnson v. Baker, rule against landlords who cannot substantiate claims. Without timely evidence, withholding the deposit is unlawful, making the landlord liable for the full amount and potential additional damages.

4. Signed Lease Existence

Landlord’s Claim: References having the signed lease.
• Law: A signed lease does not exempt the landlord from meeting Fla. Stat. §§83.49, 83.51 (habitable condition, proper deposit handling), and §§715.10–715.111 (personal property rights).
• Fact: Regardless of the lease, the landlord must still provide timely notice and adhere to statutory mandates for deposit returns and personal property handling.
• Conclusion: Possessing the lease is irrelevant to the landlord’s statutory noncompliance, reinforcing tenant’s right to a full refund and additional remedies.

5. Inventory List Signed by Melissa

Landlord’s Claim: States having an inventory signed by Melissa.
• Law: Johnson v. Baker and Fla. Stat. §83.49(3) require a properly executed, itemized inventory from the outset. Without it, the landlord cannot prove which items were damaged or missing at move-out.
• Fact: No such mutually agreed-upon, properly integrated inventory was provided at move-in. Any post-hoc claim is untimely and legally ineffective.
• Conclusion: Without a recognized inventory baseline, the landlord cannot prove damages or missing items. The time to produce such evidence is past, negating their claim.

6. Photos and Evidence Claims

Landlord’s Claim: Asserts having photos of the premises before and after.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) demands timely, itemized evidence. Landlords who fail to produce contemporaneous documentation for damages cannot later justify deposit withholding.
• Fact: The landlord did not provide these photos with the initial claim, missing the statutory deadline.
• Conclusion: Without timely disclosure, any newly mentioned evidence is legally void. The landlord’s failure to comply exposes them to owing the full amount plus statutory penalties.

7. Witnesses to Condition & Alleged Negligence

Landlord’s Claim: Says witnesses can testify to the condition and negligence.
• Law: Florida courts require timely, credible, and properly presented evidence. Generic witness claims, without sworn statements or affidavits produced at the proper time, have no legal weight.
• Fact: No sworn statements or affidavits were provided during the statutory timeframe.
• Conclusion: Unverified witness references do not cure the landlord’s procedural failures. They remain liable for return of the full deposit and other damages.

8. Receipts for Alleged Damaged Items & Garbage Removal

Landlord’s Claim: Has receipts for removal of damaged items or trash.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) requires these receipts be provided within the initial claim period.
• Fact: The landlord failed to include these receipts at the time of the original deposit claim.
• Conclusion: Attempting to justify withholding after the fact is legally impermissible. The landlord’s noncompliance solidifies the tenant’s claim.

9. Texts Allegedly Contradicting Tenant’s Claims

Landlord’s Claim: Possesses texts from tenant contradicting their claims.
• Law: All relevant evidence must be disclosed and itemized per Fla. Stat. §83.49(3). The landlord cannot surprise the tenant later with undisclosed texts.
• Fact: No such texts were provided timely. The tenant’s communications consistently show attempts to maintain and retrieve personal property lawfully.
• Conclusion: Undisclosed texts are legally irrelevant now. The landlord’s failure to produce them earlier forfeits their evidentiary value.

10. September 4th Text About Leaving Town

Landlord’s Claim: Misquotes tenant’s message to imply abandonment.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §715.104 mandates that the landlord issue written notice before considering property abandoned.
• Fact: The landlord never provided the required abandonment notice. The tenant’s full text shows intent to retrieve belongings, not abandon them.
• Conclusion: Selective quoting is bad faith. By ignoring statutory abandonment procedures, the landlord risks treble damages and punitive damages.

11. Phone Records & No Calls Argument

Landlord’s Claim: States tenant never called to retrieve property.
• Law: Florida statutes rely on written notice and proper documentation, not phone calls.
• Fact: The tenant repeatedly made written requests for retrieving personal property, which the landlord ignored.
• Conclusion: Phone logs are immaterial. The landlord’s disregard for written requests and statutory obligations cements their liability.

12. Uncertainty About Personal Property & Alleged Delivery After Lease

Landlord’s Claim: Cannot confirm property presence, denies conversion.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §§715.10–715.111 require landlords to issue a written notice and allow tenants to recover possessions. Marketing tenant’s items as amenities constitutes conversion.
• Fact: The landlord failed to provide required abandonment notices and used tenant’s grill for the rental listing.
• Conclusion: Uncertainty does not excuse conversion. Unauthorized use of tenant’s property may result in treble damages, punitive damages, and compensation for emotional distress.

13. Counteroffer of 500 for Personal Property

Landlord’s Offer: Proposes 1,500 deposit + 
§
4,500 deposit plus 8,710.62), tenant will pursue maximum damages in court, including treble and punitive damages.

14. Willingness to Talk or Mediate

Landlord’s Claim: Suggests informal settlement or mediation.
• Law: Landlord must first comply with Fla. Stat. §§83.49, 83.51, and 715.10–715.111 before proposing resolution.
• Fact: The landlord’s repeated noncompliance and failure to meet basic statutory requirements negates the need for further informal discussions.
• Conclusion: Without immediate full payment, there is no basis for mediation. Continued refusal triggers litigation and pursuit of full statutory remedies.

15. Impact of Hurricanes & Personal Circumstances

Landlord’s Claim: References hurricane impacts and personal challenges.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §§83.49, 83.51, 715.10–715.111 do not provide exceptions for hardship. Statutory deadlines and requirements remain binding.
• Fact: The landlord never sought extensions or provided explanations at the time compliance was due.
• Conclusion: External factors do not excuse statutory breaches. The landlord remains fully liable for the full amount plus any enhanced damages.

Final Demand and Deadline

After reviewing all claims:
• The landlord repeatedly failed to provide timely, itemized evidence or comply with abandonment procedures.
• The tenant seeks full compensation: $8,710.62 (security deposit + personal property).
• Noncompliance exposes the landlord to treble damages under Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 715.104, plus punitive damages for willful misconduct and emotional distress compensation.
• Provide a 15-day deadline from receipt of this final communication to pay the full amount.
• If payment is not received, the tenant will proceed to circuit court and seek maximum allowable damages.

General Denial & Self-Characterization
Landlord’s Claim: “I disagree with and deny all your allegations… I always treated you with kindness, empathy, professionalism, and regard for the law.”

Law: Under Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 83.51, a landlord’s legal responsibilities are objective and not subject to personal interpretation. The law mandates proper handling of security deposits, timely notice, safe housing conditions, and adherence to statutory procedures for any personal property left behind. Your subjective view of your behavior cannot override these statutory directives

Fact: Despite your claim of kindness and professionalism, you failed to provide an itemized statement of deductions from the security deposit within the statutory timeframe, did not ensure proper safety and habitability measures after a documented break-in, and neglected to follow the procedures required by Fla. Stat. §§715.10–715.111 regarding abandoned or unclaimed personal property. Your failure to meet these objective legal criteria is well-documented and not mitigated by any personal sentiment.

Conclusion: Your personal feelings and self-assessment do not exempt you from meeting rigid statutory obligations. Florida law is clear and unambiguous: you must comply with the statutes governing deposit returns, maintenance, and personal property handling. Having not done so, your claim of “regard for the law” collapses under the weight of your demonstrable noncompliance. No amount of subjective “kindness” changes these objective legal failures.

Emotional Appeal & Surprise at the Dispute
Landlord’s Claim: “I never imagined that our relationship would end in any sort of dispute… surprised, disappointed, and somewhat disheartened.”

Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3) mandates strict compliance with notice and documentation requirements related to security deposits, and Fla. Stat. §83.51 addresses the landlord’s duty to maintain a habitable property. Surprise or disappointment does not alter or delay these legal imperatives.

Fact: You were legally required to provide prompt, itemized justifications for any deposit withholding at the conclusion of the tenancy. You did not. You were required to maintain the property in a safe and habitable condition, including addressing known security risks post-break-in. You failed. These are statutory duties that do not vanish simply because you did not anticipate a conflict.

Conclusion: Your emotional response is immaterial. Statutory obligations persist regardless of your expectations or personal feelings. The dispute arose because you did not adhere to the specific legal steps required, not because I unfairly sought a confrontation. Under Florida law, the landlord’s compliance or noncompliance determines outcomes, not emotional sentiments.

Allegation of Inaccuracy or Exaggeration
Landlord’s Claim: “Much of what you say is not accurate and/or exaggerated.”

Law: Under Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a), a landlord must provide an itemized list of damages claimed against the deposit within the statutory timeframe, accompanied by supporting evidence. Without timely, concrete evidence, the landlord’s withholding is presumptively unlawful.

Fact: You have not presented timely, itemized evidence. Instead of addressing the specific factual inaccuracies you allege, you rely on vague denials without producing the statutorily required documentation (e.g., detailed receipts, properly executed inventories, time-stamped photographs). Your general claim of “inaccuracy” thus stands unsupported and legally insufficient.

Conclusion: In the absence of timely, legally compliant evidence, the law defaults to protecting the tenant’s deposit. Calling my claims inaccurate without furnishing the requisite proof at the required time fails to meet the legal standard Florida law imposes. Your credibility and position erode further each time you invoke unsupported allegations of exaggeration without the documentation the statutes demand.

Signed Lease
Landlord’s Claim: “I have a copy of the written lease signed by you.”

Law: While the lease establishes our contractual relationship, Fla. Stat. §§83.49, 83.51, and §§715.10–715.111 impose statutory duties separate from lease terms. No clause in the lease can diminish or negate these statutory obligations.

Fact: Possession of a signed lease merely confirms we had a landlord-tenant relationship. It does not justify withholding the deposit without following statutory processes or failing to provide the maintenance and safety measures required by law. Nor does it excuse your failure to follow the formal procedures outlined in the statutes governing personal property retrieval.

Conclusion: The existence of a signed lease is not a shield against statutory noncompliance. It does not nullify your obligation to send proper notices, itemized breakdowns, and comply with security and maintenance standards. By failing to meet these duties, you remain in violation of Florida law, regardless of having a signed lease in hand.

Inventory List Signed by Melissa
Landlord’s Claim: “I have a copy of the inventory signed by Melissa when you moved in.”
__
Law: Pursuant to Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) and case law such as Johnson v. Baker, a landlord must establish a verified baseline condition of the property to justify later damage claims. Such an inventory must be properly executed, fully acknowledged by all parties (including both tenants), and integrated into the lease at the outset.

Fact: I never reviewed, signed, or agreed to any inventory list, and it was never attached as a mutually acknowledged lease addendum. You have not shown that this alleged inventory was lawfully incorporated at move-in, nor provided at any appropriate point to establish a baseline for damage claims. Without my signature and the proper formalization, the alleged inventory list fails to meet the evidentiary standards Florida law requires for damage justification.

Conclusion: An alleged inventory that was never fully executed by all parties and never integrated into the lease documents at the appropriate time is legally meaningless. Without a legitimate, verified baseline condition documented at move-in, you cannot credibly assert tenant-caused damages later. Any claim based on this alleged inventory is legally void.

I am not offering another informal chance for you to fix this evidentiary gap. Either promptly pay the full $8,710.62 owed or face the consequences in circuit court, where the burden of your statutory failures may be met with treble and punitive damages.

Photos and Evidence Claims
Landlord’s Claim: “I have photos of the premises before and after…”

Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) demands timely, itemized evidence accompanying the initial deposit claim. Merely claiming to have photos after-the-fact is legally insufficient.

Fact: If these photos genuinely showed tenant-caused damage, you should have presented them immediately during the statutory notice period, not long after. Your failure to do so when legally required to proves these alleged images cannot retroactively justify deposit deductions. They do not meet the stringent procedural and evidentiary requirements established by Florida law.

Conclusion: Late claims of possessing photographic evidence carry no legal weight. You missed the statutory window to present them as part of a valid, itemized damages statement. Without adherence to procedural timelines, such evidence is now rendered moot, leaving your withholding of the deposit unsupported and unlawful.

Witnesses to Condition & Alleged Negligence
Landlord’s Claim: “I have witnesses to the condition… witnesses to your negligent treatment…”

Law: Florida courts require objective, contemporaneous evidence that aligns with statutory requirements, not vague witness references. Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) places the onus on you to timely and properly document damages.

Fact: You have not named these witnesses, produced sworn affidavits, or shown how their testimony corroborates a properly itemized and timely damage claim. Without official statements tied to statutory notice requirements, unnamed witness claims fail as legitimate evidence.

Conclusion: Unspecified witnesses cannot remedy statutory noncompliance. The legal process demands documented, timely, and admissible evidence. Vague mentions of witnesses do not salvage your case from the statutory failures you have already committed.

Receipts for Alleged Damaged Items & Garbage Removal
Landlord’s Claim: “I have receipts for removal of excessively damaged items…”

Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) mandates that landlords provide itemized costs and supporting documentation within the legally specified timeframe.

Fact: You never presented these receipts in a timely manner. Attempting to rely on them now violates both the letter and spirit of the statutes designed to protect tenants from after-the-fact justifications. The law does not permit you to produce critical evidence at your convenience; deadlines and procedures exist for a reason.

Conclusion: Your belated mention of receipts is irrelevant. You forfeited the legal right to use such evidence by not disclosing it at the required time. Absent timely compliance, you cannot retroactively legitimize your deductions.

Texts Allegedly Contradicting My Claims
Landlord’s Claim: “I have texts from you that contradict your Response claims.”

Law: Under Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a), you must promptly provide documentation that justifies withholding my deposit. You must also comply with Fla. Stat. §715.104 for personal property handling.

Fact: If these texts were genuinely exculpatory or indicative of tenant abandonment, you should have included them in your initial claim or promptly upon disputing my demands. Instead, you merely assert their existence without producing them as timely evidence.

Conclusion: Late, unverified claims about having contradictory texts hold no weight. Courts and statutes require immediate and transparent evidence. Without producing such texts in a legally compliant manner, you fail to refute my claims or justify your actions, leaving your position legally indefensible.

September 4th Text About Leaving Town (Partial Quotation)
Landlord’s Claim: “I have your Sept. 4th pm text… ‘leaving town… indefinitely’”

Law: Fla. Stat. §715.104 requires you to provide proper written notice and an opportunity for retrieval before treating property as abandoned.

Fact: You selectively quoted my text to imply I abandoned my property. The full text states: “Hi Luther, I’m leaving town tonight indefinitely. It’s the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property. I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank you.” In context, this message reaffirms my intent to retrieve my possessions, not abandon them. My documented efforts to reclaim items refute any claim of abandonment.

Conclusion: By quoting only part of my text to distort its meaning, you demonstrate bad faith and further undermine your credibility. A lawful abandonment determination requires statutory notice and a reasonable retrieval period, none of which you provided. Misrepresenting my communications does not erase your statutory failures; it only reinforces them.

Phone Records & No Calls Argument
Landlord’s Claim: “I have phone records that show you never called me…”

Law: Florida’s landlord-tenant statutes do not demand phone calls as the method of communication for deposit disputes or personal property retrieval. Written documentation is the legally preferred standard of evidence.

Fact: I relied on written requests—emails, letters, texts—creating a clear legal record. The law does not hinge upon phone calls. Your emphasis on calls that never occurred is a distraction from your failure to respond to the written communications that Florida law deems more definitive and enforceable.

Conclusion: The absence of phone calls is irrelevant. Legally, what matters is your response to my documented written requests, which you ignored. Since Florida statutes prioritize transparent, written notice and disclosure, your argument that I never called does nothing to justify your continued statutory noncompliance or withholding of my property.

Uncertainty About Personal Property & Alleged Delivery After Lease
Landlord’s Claim: “I cannot confirm or deny… I have not converted or sold any personal property…”

Law: Fla. Stat. §§715.10–715.111 outline the procedures you must follow before disposing of or converting tenant property, including giving proper notice and allowing a retrieval window.

Fact: Your inability to confirm property presence does not excuse failing to send the legally required notices. Advertising items like my grill as rental amenities strongly suggests you have retained and used my property for your benefit. You never provided any statutory notice of abandonment or followed the protocol for handling property as required by the statutes.

Conclusion: Uncertainty is no defense under Florida law. By ignoring the statutory process and benefiting from my property, you have effectively converted it. This wrongful conversion could expose you to treble damages and punitive damages in circuit court. Without strict compliance, your actions stand as unlawful appropriation of tenant-owned property.

Your 500 Property Counteroffer
Landlord’s Claim: “I propose… 500 for personal property… no further litigation.”

Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49 and related statutes uphold the tenant’s right to full deposit return absent properly documented deductions. Similarly, Fla. Stat. §§715.10–715.111 support full tenant rights over personal property unless the landlord follows legal disposal procedures.

Fact: My claims total 4,500 security deposit and $4,210.62 in personal property value. Your minimal offer fails to acknowledge your statutory noncompliance and the fact that no legitimate evidence supports withholding or converting my property. Courts have historically penalized landlords who fail to meet these evidentiary and procedural requirements, potentially awarding treble, punitive, and emotional distress damages.

Conclusion: Your offer is legally insufficient and financially insulting given the documented statutory violations. No partial measures or meager settlements will be entertained. You have forfeited informal remedy opportunities by refusing to comply with Florida law. The only acceptable path to avoiding litigation and severe legal consequences is immediate payment of the full $8,710.62.

Willingness to Talk or Mediate
Landlord’s Claim: “We need to talk… I am willing to attend mediation or other expedited dispute resolution.”

Law: Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 715.104 do not require me to engage in verbal negotiations after you have failed to meet statutory deadlines and documentary requirements. Mediation is an option, but it does not excuse prior noncompliance.

Fact: I have relied on written communications, as Florida law heavily favors clear, documented channels to establish a transparent record of compliance or noncompliance. You ignored these, missing your statutory windows, and now offer mediation only after the fact. Without adherence to legal obligations at the appropriate times, talk of mediation is too little, too late.

Conclusion: Your sudden openness to mediated discussions cannot reverse your missed deadlines or rectify the absence of legally required disclosures. Any hope of informal resolution has passed. Now, only immediate, full payment of $8,710.62 can avert circuit court proceedings, where you face treble damages, punitive damages, and other severe legal and financial repercussions.


• The lease explicitly identifies Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk as landlords, omitting Amarlu Enterprises or any associated assumed business names (Amarlu Enterprises, Amarlu Company, Amarlu Consulting).

Payment Instructions:
• Tenants were provided with ten (10) pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes at move-in, directing payments to Amarlu Enterprises at 231 Government Ave 3094, Hickory, NC 28602.

• Despite Amarlu Enterprises collecting rent, it was not disclosed in the lease agreement nor registered to conduct business in Florida.

Amarlu Enterprises and Assumed Business Names:
• Amarlu Enterprises is a North Carolina-registered entity, with assumed business names of Amarlu Enterprises, Amarlu Company, and Amarlu Consulting, filed on July 7, 2023 with the Catawba County Register of Deeds.

• Furthermore, and with critical influence on the outcome of this dispute, Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina entity owned by Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk, is not registered as a foreign entity with the Florida Division of Corporations, violating Florida Statutes § 605.0902. However, this entity is collecting revenue illegally and in the shadows within the State of Florida via rental income.

Evidence Supporting the Tenant’s Case:
• Proof of payments instructed to be made directly to Amarlu Enterprises.

• The lease agreement omits Amarlu Enterprises entirely.

• Instructions to tenants to use pre-stamped envelopes addressed to Amarlu Enterprises.

• Personal property worth $4,200 was withheld by the landlords without legal justification.

• The landlords made a counteroffer of only 1,500 for the security deposit, failing to address the broader legal issues.

Landlord’s Professional Background:
• Luther Rollins is a licensed attorney in good standing with the North Carolina State Bar and holds his license officially with the ** Missouri Bar**, practicing in North Carolina as an out-of-state member. His legal expertise heightens the expectation of compliance with state laws and ethical obligations. This is most critical as it relates to punitive claims against the landlord.

Legal Issues Identified

Failure to Register as a Foreign Entity:
• Florida law requires out-of-state entities like Amarlu Enterprises to register before conducting business in the state.

• By collecting $45,000 in rent without registration, Amarlu Enterprises violated Florida Statutes § 605.0902. Under the law, this immediately renders the lease fully illegal, any dispute for security deposits defaults to the tenants' favor, property value to be restored in full, etc. Further, this could result in civil penalties.

Fraudulent Misrepresentation:
• The lease failed to disclose Amarlu Enterprises, yet tenants were instructed to make payments to this entity.

• Fraudulent misrepresentation arises from this intentional omission, as tenants were deprived of a full understanding of the parties involved in the agreement.

Violation of Florida Landlord-Tenant Laws:
• Florida Statutes § 83.49 requires landlords to return security deposits within 30 days of lease termination or provide an itemized list of deductions if retaining any portion of the security deposit, thus placing a claim on the deposit. Failure to comply can result in the forfeiture of the deposit and statutory penalties. The landlord met this timely obligation by issuing a certified letter on the 30th and final day of the 30-day window from the day the tenant vacated the property.

• Withholding personal property valued at $4,200 violates Florida Statutes § 83.67, which prohibits landlords from unlawfully retaining or disposing of tenants' property.

Ethical and Professional Misconduct:
• As a licensed attorney, Luther Rollins is held to higher ethical standards. His involvement in structuring the lease and payment arrangements in violation of Florida law raises questions about professional misconduct under North Carolina and Missouri bar rules.

Tax Evasion:
• Payments directed to Amarlu Enterprises, an unregistered entity, raise concerns about compliance with Florida and federal tax laws. The lack of registration suggests an attempt to avoid Florida’s tax obligations.

Payment Instructions:
• Upon move-in, tenants were provided with pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes directing all rent payments to Amarlu Enterprises at 231 Government Ave 3094, Hickory, NC 28602.

• Every payment for the full lease term (totaling $45,000) was made to Amarlu Enterprises, despite its omission from the lease agreement.

• This discrepancy between the lease agreement and payment practices forms the basis for allegations of fraud and misrepresentation.

Amarlu Enterprises and Assumed Business Names:
• On July 7, 2023, Rollins and Polk filed documentation with the Catawba County Register of Deeds, certifying that Amarlu Enterprises would operate under three assumed business names:

Amarlu Enterprises.

Amarlu Company.

Amarlu Consulting.

• However, none of these entities or assumed names are registered with the Florida Division of Corporations as required by Florida Statutes § 605.0902, which mandates foreign business registration before conducting business in Florida.

• The use of an unregistered foreign entity to collect rent in Florida constitutes a direct violation of state law.

Personal Property Withheld:
• Upon termination of the lease, the landlords withheld personal property belonging to the tenants, valued at $4,200 after depreciation.

• Florida Statutes § 83.67 prohibits landlords from unlawfully retaining or disposing of tenant property. The withholding of personal items constitutes another legal violation.

Landlords’ Counteroffer:
• In response to initial demands for the return of the withheld property and a portion of the security deposit, the landlords offered:

• $500 for the personal property (far below its depreciated value).

• 4,500 security deposit.

• This counteroffer fails to address the broader legal violations, including fraudulent collection of rent and failure to register Amarlu Enterprises in Florida.

Landlord’s Legal Background:
• Luther Rollins is a licensed attorney in good standing with the North Carolina State Bar and an out-of-state member of the Missouri Bar.

• His legal expertise increases his accountability for ensuring compliance with state laws and ethical practices. Using his professional knowledge to structure lease and payment arrangements that circumvent Florida law raises serious ethical concerns and potential bar violations.

Legal Issues Identified

Violation of Florida Business Registration Laws:
• Florida Statutes § 605.0902 requires foreign entities to register with the Florida Division of Corporations before conducting business in the state.

• Amarlu Enterprises collected rent for a Florida property without registering, making its actions illegal and potentially invalidating the lease agreement.

• Consequences of this violation:

• Amarlu Enterprises cannot enforce any legal claims in Florida courts until it registers as a foreign entity.

• Tenants may seek full restitution of rent payments made to an unregistered entity.

Fraudulent Misrepresentation:
• The landlords failed to disclose Amarlu Enterprises in the lease agreement while directing payments to the entity.

• This deliberate omission constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation, depriving tenants of the opportunity to understand the true parties involved in the lease.

• Fraudulent intent is further evidenced by:

• The use of pre-stamped envelopes addressed to Amarlu Enterprises.

• The landlords’ failure to comply with Florida’s business and tax laws.

Violation of Florida Landlord-Tenant Laws:
• Security Deposit Mishandling:

• Florida Statutes § 83.49 requires landlords to return security deposits within 15 days of lease termination or provide an itemized list of deductions.

• The landlords’ failure to meet these requirements entitles the tenant to the full deposit amount, plus potential penalties for bad faith.


83.50 - Disclosure of Landlord's Address - The LEASE states that the Landlord must list a "landlord address" and certain written permissions are required to be sent to the landlord in writing. The landlord did not list his address in Hickory, NC. Rather, the landlord listed the same address as the leased property in which the lease was being executed for. It could be stated that written permission for any claim such as altering the property was not possible due to the written permissions being executed per the lease and thus the written requests for permission would just end up in the same mailbox that attempted to mail requests to the landlord. this is another example of bad, improper, unethical, sneaky attention to detail.
The landlord address listed is the same address as the leased home address. More bad faith?
• Unlawful Retention of Property:

• Florida Statutes § 83.67 prohibits landlords from withholding or disposing of tenant property. The landlords’ actions in withholding $4,200 worth of personal property violate this statute.

Tax Evasion:
• By funneling rental income through an unregistered entity, the landlords may have failed to report income properly to Florida tax authorities.

• This raises potential tax evasion concerns at both the state and federal levels.

Ethical and Professional Misconduct:
• As a licensed attorney, Rollins is held to higher ethical standards under bar rules in North Carolina and Missouri.

• Structuring a fraudulent lease arrangement to avoid legal and tax obligations could result in disciplinary action from the respective bar associations.

Repetitive, Coercive Communications and Misrepresentation of Legal Requirements**

Your persistent attempts to coerce me into a phone call, despite my clear, written request for all communications to remain in writing, constitute a pattern of harassment—especially given your self-declared status as a “corporate attorney” and the intimidation factor introduced by your “luther2law” email address. Florida’s landlord-tenant statutes do not compel me to engage in phone discussions to resolve disputes or address your claims. Yet you continued to push for verbal contact, misrepresenting that the law requires such a step.

Timeline of Intensive Harassment on October 29, 2024:
Over the course of approximately six hours, you escalated your pressure tactics, placing repeated phone calls and leaving multiple voicemails, each attempt separated by roughly two-hour intervals. After ignoring my standing request for written correspondence, you made two phone calls followed by two voicemails, all within a short timeframe. When I did not respond, you followed up with a text message, again approximately two hours later, thereby punctuating the day with a relentless cycle of unsolicited outreach.

Quoted Text Message Written by Luther Rollins, Landlord:

After these repeated phone contacts and voicemails, you sent me the following text message on October 29, 2024:

“Hi Stephen, I called you a couple times today to discuss the Tenant Response & Dispute you sent to me which I recently received. I hope we could talk (and I believe we are both supposed to) try to resolve amicably. I am available most days this week 9:00am-ish till about 10pm.”

In this message, you again attempt to frame the resolution process as something that supposedly mandates a phone call, stating “I believe we are both supposed to” engage in a verbal discussion. This is categorically untrue. Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 83.51, which govern security deposits and habitability, as well as §§715.10–715.111, which outline procedures for handling personal property, impose no requirement for phone calls, verbal negotiations, or live discussions. Your claim that “we are both supposed to” have a phone call severely misrepresents the law and seeks to corner me into a scenario where I would be at a disadvantage—“outmatched by a declared lawyer”—contrary to the transparency and fairness that the statutes intend.

Impact and Legal Implications:
The repeated calls, voicemails, and now this text message—each separated by roughly two-hour intervals—display a calculated effort to erode my stance on written communication and push me into a verbally intimidating interaction. This calculated timing and insistence on a method never required by statute is a form of harassment. Your decision to leverage your attorney status, along with an email moniker implying legal expertise, only intensifies the coercive atmosphere.

Conclusion:
These actions—excessive calling, repeated voicemails, and sending a misleading text message after a series of two-hour interval attempts—violate the principle of written, verifiable communication that Florida law heavily favors and I explicitly requested. By misrepresenting legal requirements and attempting to pressure me into a “phone call” that statutes do not mandate, you have crossed into harassment and bad-faith intimidation. This coercive behavior will not force me to abandon my legal rights or documented communication channels. Instead, it further solidifies my resolve to seek remedies permitted by Florida law, should you continue to flout statutory directives and proper dispute resolution procedures.
