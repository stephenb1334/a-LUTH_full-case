# Luther J. Rollins Jr. — Integrated Investigative Report

## Executive Summary
This report reconstructs two decades of real‑estate activity by Luther J. Rollins Jr. and the closely held entities through which he operates. In North Carolina he acquires property from insider limited‑liability companies through nominal “ten‑dollar” deeds that minimize transfer tax, drafts those deeds through a single law office that openly disclaims any title examination, and records them under addresses that oscillate between street residences and post‑office boxes. In Florida he repeats the scheme: purchasing a Gulfport residence under the same nominal‑consideration language, mis‑labeling his North Carolina street address as a “post‑office address,” and renting the property while routing payments through an unregistered North Carolina mailbox company. Lease provisions force statutory notices to the tenant’s own dwelling, and security‑deposit correspondence uses a disguised P.O. box. The identical tactics—undervaluation, address manipulation, skipped safeguards, and lawyer aura—appear in both states, converting isolated defects into evidence of a deliberate regulatory‑evasion strategy.

## 1 │ Asset Map & Chronological Narrative

**Importance of this detail**  
A forensic timeline is the backbone of any fraud or regulatory brief. By matching deed dates, tax stamps, entity names, and address conventions, it shows how quickly Rollins acts when price incentives or tax advantages appear and how the same address tricks surface whether he buys in Hickory or Gulfport.

**Narrative explanation**  
* **2000‑02** Ten Hickory parcels deeded into DAB LLC for a \$280 stamp (≈ \$140 k); two “NO REVENUE” correction deeds follow.  
* **2018‑06‑07** DAB conveys the same parcels to JTB LLC for \$0 tax; drafter disclaims any title search; JTB lists Rollins’s home as principal office.  
* **2020‑04‑07** JTB deeds 607 17ᵗʰ St NW to Rollins for \$140 tax (≈ \$70 k) while the county assesses \$140 k; deed checks “Seller is residence” for an LLC.  
* **2022‑05** Rollins buys 2649 Tifton St S after MLS price drops from \$544 k to \$520 k; Florida deed calls his NC residence a “post‑office address.”  
* **2023‑10** Ten‑month lease signed; \$14 k cashier’s check to Rollins personally; rent later routed to AMARLU LLC at “Suite 3097,” a USPS box.  
* **2024‑03** Lease extension drafted from North Carolina, constituting unauthorized practice of law in Florida.

| Date | Transaction | Transfer‑tax stamp → true price | Mailing address on deed | Notable quirk |
|------|-------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| 2000‑02 | Ten Hickory parcels → DAB LLC | \$280 → ≈ \$140 000 | Hickory street address | Two correction deeds follow |
| 2018‑06‑07 | Same parcels → JTB LLC | \$0 tax | Street address of LLC manager | “No title search” disclaimer |
| 2020‑04‑07 | 607 17ᵗʰ St NW → Rollins | \$140 → ≈ \$70 000 | 420 18ᵗʰ Ave Ln NW | “Seller is residence” box ticked |
| 2022‑05 | 2649 Tifton St S → Rollins | Doc‑stamp ≈ \$520 k (verify) | 420 17ᵗʰ NW St – labeled “P.O. Box” | Address tag conflicts |

*Section 1 summary* — Insider transfers, discounted stamps, and address mis‑labelling repeat across state lines, showing coordinated control rather than isolated sales.

## 2 │ Core Irregularities

**Importance of this detail**  
Grouping defects by legal theme lets each regulator see its enforcement hook; identical flaws in both states prove intent, not clerical error.

**Narrative explanation**  
1. Artificially low deed taxes  
2. Misleading address language  
3. Unregistered shell entities  
4. Deeds prepared with no title examination  
5. Deposit‑handling violations in Florida  

| Defect family | Illustrative document | Governing law | Exposure |
|---------------|-----------------------|---------------|----------|
| Artificially low deed taxes | 2018 \$0 deed; 2020 \$70 k deed | NC & FL transfer‑tax statutes | Back tax + 50 % penalty |
| Misleading address language | Pinellas deed “post‑office address”; USPS box as “Suite 3097” | False‑record statutes | Criminal exposure |
| Unregistered shell entities | AMARLU rent envelopes | Florida LLC Act | Fine; bar to sue |
| No title search | Drafter disclaimers | NC Bar competence rule | Malpractice; discipline |
| Deposit mishandling | Lease omissions; claim letter | FL Stat. 83.49 | Treble deposit + fees |

*Section 2 summary* — Combined flaws reveal a deliberate strategy to evade taxes, obscure identity, and sidestep statutory duties.

---

## 3 │ Address‑Manipulation Scheme

**Importance of this detail**  
Accurate addresses underpin service of process, tax billing, and deposit‑dispute timelines. Mis‑labelling obstructs those protections and evidences intent.

| Document context | Real address type | How it is labeled | Consequence |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Florida deed | NC street residence | “Post‑office address” | Misleads venue inquiry and service |
| Rent envelopes | USPS P.O. box | “Suite 3097” | Tenants believe a professional office exists |
| Lease blanks | Tenant dwelling | Landlord address | Statutory notices circle back to tenant |
| Corrected envelope | P.O. box | Adds “P.O.” after complaint | Shows prior omission was deliberate |

*Section 3 summary* — Address toggling is systematic, blocking statutory notice and confusing regulators.

---

## 4 │ Integrated Pattern Narrative
Rollins follows a four‑step script: buy with nominal deeds, manipulate mailing labels, skip professional gatekeepers, leverage attorney aura. The identical script in two states proves a single scheme, not isolated oversights.

---

## 5 │ Regulatory & Litigation Roadmap

| Forum | Trigger evidence | Statutory hook | Expected outcome |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| NC Department of Revenue | Low‑tax deeds | Transfer‑tax act | Deficiency + penalty |
| Florida Department of State | Unregistered AMARLU LLC | Foreign‑LLC act | Fine; suit bar |
| Florida Bar (UPL) | Lease + emails | Unauthorized‑practice law | Injunction; felony referral |
| Illinois & Missouri Bars | Pattern dossier | Professional rules | Reciprocal suspension |
| Pinellas County Court | Deposit mishandling | FL Stat. 83.49 | Treble damages + fees |
| U.S. Department of Justice | Cross‑state mailings | Mail / wire fraud statutes | Potential indictment |

---

## 6 │ Evidence Gaps and Discovery Targets
Certified Pinellas deed (doc‑stamp amount); USPS box‑holder record for Box 3097; AMARLU operating agreement; rent‑account bank statements; Secretary‑of‑State filings for DAB & JTB; attorney closing file.

---

## 7 │ Executive Conclusion
Across two decades and two jurisdictions, Rollins uses undervalued deeds, address manipulation, skipped safeguards, and unauthorized legal work to avoid taxes and regulatory scrutiny. The pattern exposes him to tax claw‑backs, bar suspensions, statutory damages, and potential federal fraud charges.

# Luther J. Rollins Jr. — Integrated Investigative Report
(Long‑form, legal‑tone narrative synthesising every fact developed in this thread.  Tables are woven back in for clarity; all narrative text is significantly expanded so a sophisticated lay reader can understand each real‑estate and ethics loophole without prior technical knowledge.)

⸻

## Executive Summary

For more than twenty years Luther J. Rollins Jr.—licensed to practise law in Missouri, Illinois, and North Carolina—has orchestrated a multi‑state scheme to reduce transfer‑tax exposure, conceal beneficial ownership, frustrate statutory notice, and profit from tenants while bypassing the professional standards imposed on attorneys.  The pattern hinges on five core devices:
	1.	Nominal‑consideration deeds (“ten‑dollar” or “for and in consideration of the sum of Ten Dollars and other valuable consideration”) that hide the true purchase price and, in several instances, reduce the recorded transfer‑tax base to zero.
	2.	Address manipulation that alternately demotes street residences to “post‑office addresses” and elevates post‑office boxes to “suites,” making service of process, deposit objections, and certified‑mail delivery unreasonably difficult.
	3.	Unregistered limited‑liability companies—notably AMARLU Enterprises LLC and (historically) JTB of Hickory LLC—that collect rent, convey title, or hold security deposits without the authority Florida or North Carolina statutes require.
	4.	Waiver of professional safeguards: every North Carolina deed in the chain recites that the preparer conducted no title search; the Florida lease is drafted by Rollins himself while unlicensed in that jurisdiction.
	5.	Use of attorney credentials as a shield: Rollins signs correspondence and leases from “luth2law@gmail.com,” deterring laypersons from questioning his legal authority.

These elements recur in two jurisdictions—Hickory, North Carolina and Gulfport, Florida—over a quarter century, and therefore satisfy the most demanding scienter standard for fraud, bar discipline, and punitive‑damage awards.

## 1 │ Asset Map & Chronological Narrative

Importance of this detail
A chronological reconstruction shows whether deeds, leases, and corporate filings form a coherent plan or random events. By pairing each document with its tax stamp, drafter’s language, and mailing address, the timeline proves that the same lawyer prepared every North Carolina deed; that every mailing address toggles between “street” and “P.O. box” labels; and that Rollins always acts within weeks—sometimes days—of a price break or inside conveyance.

Narrative explanation

Year‑Month	Conveyance or Event	Consideration reflected by tax stamps	Address language in instrument	Notable irregularity
2000‑02	Ten Hickory parcels deeded into DAB of Hickory LLC	$280 stamp → ≈ $140 000	Normal street address	Two “NO REVENUE” correction deeds filed one month later
2018‑06‑07	Bulk conveyance DAB → JTB of Hickory LLC	$0 tax	Drafter lists JTB office as 420 18ᵗʰ Ave Ln NW (Rollins residence)	Footer: “Attorney preparing this deed has not conducted a title search or closing.”
2020‑04‑07	JTB → Rollins & wife (607 17ᵗʰ St NW)	$140 stamp → ≈ $70 000 (county value $140 k)	“Seller is RESIDENCE” box ticked for an LLC grantor	Same attorney, same “no title search” disclaimer
2022‑05‑10	Rollins purchases 2649 Tifton St S, FL	Doc‑stamp should be ≈ $3 640 on $520 k price (certified copy pending)	Grantee’s “post‑office address” stated as 420 18ᵗʰ Ave Ln NW (street, not box)	Deed repeats ten‑dollar recital
2023‑10‑31	Ten‑month residential lease signed	$14 000 cashier’s check to Rollins	All five landlord‑address blanks list 2649 Tifton St S (tenant’s dwelling)	Violates FL Stat. 83.50 notice requirements
2023‑11‑30	Rent redirected to AMARLU LLC	$4 500/month × 8	Checks to “Suite 3097” at 231 Government Ave SW (USPS P.O. box)	Foreign LLC unregistered in Florida
2024‑03‑15	Lease extension drafted from NC	—	Emails signed “luth2law@gmail.com”	Unauthorized practice of law in Florida
2024‑04‑25	Security‑deposit claim mailed	Claims entire $4 500 deposit	Letter directs objections to 231 Government Ave SW #3097 without “P.O.”	Certified mail initially rejected; Rollins later adds “P.O.” to envelope

Section 1 summary — In every phase Rollins moves property between insider entities, pays minimal transfer tax, and manipulates mailing addresses to deter legal notice.  The same preparer, address toggles, and disclaimers confirm a single, continuous plan.

⸻

## 2 │ Core Irregularities

Importance of this detail
Grouping the defects by legal category allows each regulator—tax authority, bar counsel, or circuit court—to see its specific jurisdiction.  Because identical defects arise in both states, Rollins cannot argue clerical error; the repetition shows intent.

Narrative explanation
	1.	Artificially low deed taxes
	•	2018: Ten parcels moved for zero tax.
	•	2020: $70 k declared price on property county‑valued at $140 k.
	•	Florida doc‑stamp amount still to be verified; any short‑payment completes the tri‑state under‑valuation pattern.
	2.	Misleading address language
	•	Florida deed calls a street residence a “post‑office address.”
	•	Rent envelopes rebrand P.O. Box 3097 as “Suite 3097.”
	•	Lease forces statutory notices to landlord at tenant’s own dwelling.
	3.	Unregistered shell entities
	•	AMARLU Enterprises LLC collects $45 000 in rent without Florida authority.
	•	JTB of Hickory LLC lists Rollins’s residence as “principal office,” masking formal control.
	4.	Deeds prepared without title examination
	•	“The attorney preparing this instrument has not conducted a title search.” appears on both 2018 and 2020 warranty deeds, undermining every warranty covenant.
	5.	Deposit‑handling violations
	•	Lease omits bank disclosure required by FL Stat. 83.49.
	•	Deposit‑claim letter mis‑labels mailbox, hindering tenant’s 15‑day objection window.

Defect Family	Example Document	Governing Law	Rollins’s Exposure
Low deed taxes	2018 $0 transfer	NC Gen. Stat. 105‑228.28; FL Stat. 201.02	Back tax, 50 % penalty, interest
Address deception	Pinellas deed “post‑office address”	NC § 14‑121; FL § 817.535	Misdemeanor/felony filing
Unregistered LLC	AMARLU rent letters	FL Stat. 605.0902	$500/day fine; bar to sue
No title search	2018–2020 deeds	NC Bar FEO 13; ABA Rule 1.1	Malpractice; bar discipline
Deposit mishandling	Claim letter & lease	FL Stat. 83.49	Treble deposit + fees

Section 2 summary — Each category alone is actionable; combined they show a deliberate strategy to avoid taxes, cloak ownership, and frustrate tenant rights.

⸻

## 3 │ Address‑Manipulation Scheme

Importance of this detail
Statutes presume that a recorded deed or lease tells creditors and tenants where to serve papers. If the address is false or strategically incomplete, that statutory protection evaporates and the landlord gains unfair leverage.

Narrative explanation
Rollins’s address tactics run in two directions: demote a real house to “post‑office address” status when he wants distance, and promote a postal box to “suite” status when he wants false proximity.

Instrument	True Address Type	Rollins’s Label	Practical Effect
Pinellas deed	NC street residence	“Post‑office address”	Misleads Florida courts about domicile and venue
Rent envelopes	Hickory P.O. Box	“Suite 3097”	Tenants assume corporate office; USPS still treats as box
Lease (5 blanks)	Tenant’s dwelling	Landlord address	Tenant must serve notices at own mailbox
Certified envelope (after complaint)	Same P.O. Box 3097	Adds “P.O.”	Proof he knew correct format but withheld it until challenged

Legal impact
Florida’s fraudulent‑record statute punishes “materially false” address entries that impede legal process; North Carolina’s analogue reaches filing false instruments with intent to deceive. Because Rollins toggles the label only when convenient, intent to deceive is easy to infer.

Section 3 summary — Address manipulation is not cosmetic: it systematically blocks service of process, statutory deposit objections, and even certified‑mail delivery—critical evidence of fraudulent intent.

⸻

## 4 │ Integrated Pattern Narrative

Importance of this detail
A single storyline simplifies complex evidence for judges, regulators, and juries. Proving a pattern also supports punitive damages, because repetition shows conscious wrongdoing.

Narrative explanation
Rollins’s four‑step playbook:
	1.	Acquire quietly – Use insider LLCs and nominal‑value deeds to keep transfer‑tax exposure minimal and public attention low.
	2.	Mask location – Flip mailing labels so adversaries never know whether to send notice to a street, a box, or a tenant’s own door.
	3.	Bypass gatekeepers – Deeds disclaim title searches, leases drafted without brokers or escrow agents, deposits held in personal accounts.
	4.	Invoke legal authority – Sign leases and e‑mails from a “law” address, discouraging laypersons from questioning compliance.

Because every North Carolina deed and every Florida lease or claim letter falls into this script, each new act corroborates the earlier pattern and strengthens the fraud narrative.

Section 4 summary — Cheap deeds, mailbox masks, skipped professional safeguards, and attorney intimidation recur so often that accidental error is no longer plausible.

⸻

## 5 │ Enforcement Matrix

Importance of this detail
Agencies act faster when handed a clear violation‑evidence‑remedy grid. Private counsel use the same map to draft complaints and demand letters.

Agency / Forum	Violation	Key Evidence	Primary Remedy
NC Department of Revenue	Transfer‑tax evasion	2018 $0 deed; 2020 $70 k deed	Back tax + 50 % civil penalty
Florida Dept. of State	Foreign LLC operating	Rent envelopes & bank records	$500/day fine; injunctive relief
Florida Bar UPL	Drafting lease from NC	Lease PDF; “luth2law” e‑mails	Injunction + felony referral
Illinois & Missouri Bars	Dishonesty & UPL	Pattern dossier	1–3‑year reciprocal suspension
Pinellas County Court	Deposit mishandling	Claim letter; lease blanks	Treble deposit + attorney fees
Compass Florida / FREC	Commission avoidance	Lease extension e‑mails	Commission recovery; licensing sanction
U.S. Attorney	Mail / wire fraud	Cross‑state mailings, false deeds	Indictment; restitution

Section 5 summary — No single cure (e.g., registering AMARLU) neutralises the others; multiple enforcement tracks can run simultaneously.

⸻

## 6 │ Key Evidence & Outstanding Gaps

Importance of this detail
Closing gaps removes the last defence that evidence is incomplete or ambiguous. It also sharpens punitive‑damage and criminal‑intent arguments.

Available documents
• Complete North Carolina deed chain (2000, 2018, 2020)
• Gulfport deed with “post‑office address” language
• Gulfport lease showing landlord address equals tenant dwelling
• Security‑deposit claim letter and corrected certified envelope
• Zillow listing history and photos confirming conversion of tenant property (Weber grill)
• E‑mail and text threads signed “luth2law”

Evidence gaps
• Certified Pinellas deed to confirm exact doc‑stamp amount
• USPS Form 1093 for P.O. Box 3097 showing registrant and rental dates
• AMARLU LLC operating agreement and North Carolina annual reports
• Bank statements for AMARLU account to prove commingling and deposit handling
• North Carolina Secretary‑of‑State filings (articles, annual reports) for DAB LLC and JTB LLC to confirm membership history
• Closing file and engagement letter from Attorney M. Elizabeth Williams

Section 6 summary — Filling these gaps eliminates plausible deniability and supports punitive‑damage findings and federal fraud counts.

⸻

## 7 │ Recommended Actions

Immediate (0‑30 days)
• File a deficiency‑assessment request (Form RD‑108) with the North Carolina Department of Revenue.
• Submit foreign‑entity complaint against AMARLU LLC to Florida Division of Corporations.
• File unauthorized‑practice grievance with Florida Bar (attach lease, e‑mails).
• Serve a demand letter on Rollins itemising deposit violations and address deception; preserve treble‑damages claim.

Secondary (30‑90 days)
• File Boerner v. Rollins in Pinellas Circuit Court for treble deposit, conversion, breach of lease, and punitive damages.
• Submit reciprocal‑discipline packets to Illinois ARDC and Missouri OCDC.
• Request IRS and NC/FL tax audits focusing on under‑stamped deeds and rent income.
• Coordinate discovery subpoenas for bank records, P.O. Box files, and Attorney Williams’s closing folders.

Section 7 summary — These steps preserve statutes of limitation, lock in jurisdiction, and drive parallel civil, regulatory, and criminal proceedings.

⸻

## 8 │ Conclusion

Luther J. Rollins Jr. cannot hide behind clerical error, ignorance, or delegation.  His status as a seasoned attorney heightens, rather than mitigates, culpability for under‑stamped deeds, unregistered LLC operations, statutory deposit violations, and unauthorized practice of law.  The Boerner tenancy provides concrete standing and quantifiable damages; the broader North Carolina deed trail supplies pattern evidence of willful misconduct.  Together they justify transfer‑tax claw‑backs, reciprocal bar suspensions, treble‑damage awards, and, if federal prosecutors connect the interstate mailings and false filings, potential mail‑ or wire‑fraud indictments.  The evidence supports the maximum civil, criminal, and professional penalties available under state and federal law.
