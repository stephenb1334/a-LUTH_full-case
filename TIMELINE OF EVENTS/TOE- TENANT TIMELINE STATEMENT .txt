Pre-Move-In and Lease Commencement: A Definitive and Strategically Imperative Account

This section provides a definitive and strategically imperative account of all significant events, communications, and interactions that occurred prior to and on the official commencement date of the lease agreement, November 1, 2023. This meticulously detailed narrative is not merely a recounting of facts; it is a carefully constructed foundation for understanding the subsequent disputes, highlighting potential irregularities, misrepresentations, and violations that were deliberately woven into the fabric of this tenancy from its very inception. It is designed to be a powerful tool in building a compelling case, leaving no room for ambiguity or misinterpretation.

I. Initial Contact, Representation, and Lease Negotiation: The Genesis of a Deceptive Scheme

Realtor as Primary Contact and Strategic Gatekeeper: Zach Steinberger, a licensed real estate agent with COMPASS Realty, strategically positioned himself as the sole point of contact for the tenants, Stephen Boerner and Melissa Bemer. He acted as a gatekeeper, controlling the flow of information and access to the landlords, Luther J. Rollins, Jr., and Mary O. Polk. This deliberate control was a key element in the unfolding scheme.
Dual Representation and Inherent Conflict of Interest: Steinberger's dual role as listing agent, rental agent, and de facto property manager created an inherent conflict of interest. This allowed him to prioritize the landlords' interests over the tenants', potentially obscuring critical information and manipulating the process to their advantage. This conflict was not a mere oversight but a calculated strategy.
Lease Agreement Details: A Contractual Trap: The lease agreement was for a residential property located at 2649 Tifton St. S, Gulfport, FL 33711. The lease term was set to begin on November 1, 2023, and end on August 31, 2024. The security deposit was established at $4,500, a substantial sum that would later become a focal point of the dispute. This was not just a financial transaction; it was a carefully crafted contractual trap.
Communication Channels and Deliberate Lack of Transparency: Initial communications were primarily conducted via email and text message, with Zach Steinberger using his COMPASS Realty email address and cell phone number. Luther Rollins, Jr., was conspicuously absent from these initial communications, creating a deliberate sense of distance and lack of direct accountability. This was not a passive omission but an active strategy to shield the landlords from direct scrutiny.
Pre-Lease Conversation: A Calculated Disclosure of Legal Authority: During casual conversations with Zach Steinberger prior to the lease signing, the tenants inquired about Luther Rollins, Jr., as they were interested in getting to know the faceless individual behind the lease agreement. Steinberger strategically disclosed that Luther was a lawyer and seemed eager to work with someone who potentially had many properties. Steinberger specifically discussed the strategy of working with a smaller landlord, compared to larger landlords, like what Luther seemed to be at the time. This disclosure, while seemingly innocuous, was a calculated move to establish credibility and potentially intimidate the tenants with the implied legal authority of Luther. It was a subtle but powerful form of psychological manipulation.
II. Move-In Costs, Payment Instructions, and Initial Payment: A Web of Misdirection and Control

Total Move-In Costs: A Substantial Financial Commitment Designed to Entrap: The tenants were required to pay a total of $14,000 prior to receiving the keys and taking possession of the property. This substantial financial commitment was explicitly communicated by Zach Steinberger and comprised:
Security Deposit: $4,500 (equal to one month's rent)
First Month's Rent: $4,500
Last Month's Rent: $4,500
Pet Deposit: $500 This was not just a financial transaction; it was a deliberate strategy to establish a significant financial stake for the tenants, making them more vulnerable to exploitation.
Payment Method: A Calculated Instruction to Obscure the True Recipient: Zach Steinberger explicitly instructed the tenants to make the initial payment of $14,000 via cashier's check, payable to Luther Rollins, Jr. This instruction was provided verbally and via text message. This instruction was significant as it aligned with the name of one of the landlords on the lease agreement, providing a false sense of security and legitimacy to the transaction. It was a calculated move to obscure the true recipient of the funds and create a false sense of trust.
Initial Payment Discrepancy: A Minor Error, a Major Foreshadowing of Incompetence: The tenants initially issued a cashier's check for $13,500, inadvertently omitting the $500 pet deposit. This error, while minor, foreshadowed the lack of attention to detail and potential for future oversights and misrepresentations on the part of the landlords and their agent.
Check Delivery Process: A Chain of Indirect Transactions Designed to Distance the Landlords:
Stephen Boerner hand-delivered the $13,500 cashier's check to a COMPASS Realty front-desk worker at Zach Steinberger's office in downtown St. Petersburg. This worker was an employee of COMPASS Realty, acting as a representative of Zach Steinberger in his absence. The delivery was made during regular business hours, further distancing the landlords from the transaction and creating a layer of insulation from direct accountability.
Melissa Bemer subsequently coordinated with Zach Steinberger to deliver the remaining $500 in cashier's checks, ensuring the total move-in cost of $14,000 was covered at the time of the lease signing. This second delivery was also made to the COMPASS Realty office, reinforcing the indirect nature of the transaction and the landlords' deliberate avoidance of direct contact.
Timing of Payments: A Rushed and Unorganized Process Designed to Create Confusion: The process of signing the lease, acquiring, and dropping off cashier's checks took place on or around September 24th and 30th, 2023. The exact dates are not fully documented but are approximated based on available records, highlighting the lack of organization and transparency in the process. This was not a mere oversight but a deliberate strategy to create confusion and potentially exploit the tenants' vulnerability.
III. Lease Signing, Key Exchange, and Initial Property Access: A Flawed Foundation Built on Deception

Lease Execution: A Digital Deception Designed to Obscure the Terms: The lease agreement was executed digitally through turbotenant.com in the late hours of the same day it was sent to the tenants. Zach Steinberger sent the lease to the tenants via turbotenant.com, and the tenants executed their version of the lease within an hour of receiving it. Zach Steinberger had previously sent text messages to the tenants stating that there were other interested parties, but the tenants were first in line and should move quickly, creating a sense of pressure and urgency. This rushed process prevented the tenants from thoroughly reviewing the lease and identifying potential issues. Upon accessing the turbotenant.com dashboard, the tenants noted that Zach Steinberger was listed as the landlord, which conflicted with the lease agreement. This discrepancy was not corrected until after the lease had ended when Stephen Boerner requested a copy of the executed lease agreement and re-entered the turbotenant.com login screen, highlighting the realtor's control over the platform and the lease itself. This was not a mere oversight but a deliberate attempt to obscure the terms of the agreement and create a false sense of security.
Key Acquisition: A Direct Encounter, a Missed Opportunity for Transparency: The keys were provided during an on-site move-in attended by Luther Rollins, Jr. Zach Steinberger was not present. Luther Rollins, Jr., provided the keys and alleged to have presented Melissa Bemer with an inventory list that he alleged she signed. However, Luther Rollins, Jr., did not get signatures on the inventory list of the property's furniture and accessories by all four parties on the lease agreement. Stephen Boerner has never seen this inventory list before, during, or after vacating the property, and it was never formalized as an addendum and attached to the lease agreement in transparency. This lack of formal documentation and the absence of all parties during the inventory process was a deliberate attempt to create a false narrative and set the stage for future disputes.
Initial Property Access: A Limited View Designed to Conceal Defects: The tenants were granted access to the property on or around October 30, 2023, for the purpose of moving in. This access was granted by Luther Rollins, Jr., providing a limited view of the property and its condition before the official lease commencement. This was not a mere convenience but a deliberate strategy to conceal potential defects and issues with the property.
IV. Post-Lease Signing, Pre-Move-In Communication, and Payment Instructions: A Deliberate Strategy of Delay and Deception

Lack of Payment Instructions: A Calculated Omission Designed to Create Confusion: Despite the lease agreement being signed and the initial payment made, the tenants did not receive clear instructions on how to make subsequent monthly rent payments. This lack of communication was a deliberate omission, designed to create confusion and potentially set the stage for future disputes. It was a calculated move to maintain control and exploit the tenants' vulnerability.
Initial Inquiry: A Futile Attempt to Seek Clarity: On November 23, 2023, Stephen Boerner contacted the landlord via text message to inquire about payment instructions, as none had been provided by that time. This initial request went unanswered, setting a precedent for future communication issues and demonstrating a deliberate lack of responsiveness from the landlords. It was a clear signal that the landlords were not interested in open and transparent communication.
Second Inquiry and Response: A Calculated Delay Designed to Create Undue Pressure: On November 29, 2023, the tenant made another request for payment instructions via text message and email. The landlord, Luther Rollins, Jr., responded on the same day, November 29, 2023, stating that payment instructions had been mailed. This response, while seemingly prompt, was strategically timed to create undue pressure on the tenants and set them up for potential failure.
Late Payment Instructions: A Deliberate Imposition Designed to Create a Sense of Urgency: The package containing these instructions was received on November 29, 2023, at the property located at 2649 Tifton St. S, Gulfport, FL 33711, just two days before the first of eight monthly recurring rental payments were due on December 1, 2023. This caused undue pressure without acknowledgment on the landlord's behalf that he was inflicting that nor providing, if there would be an extension because of such a delay in instruction. This deliberate delay was a clear attempt to create a sense of urgency and potentially set the tenants up for failure. It was a calculated move to maintain control and exploit the tenants' vulnerability.
Amarlu Enterprises Introduction: A Hidden Entity Designed to Obscure the True Recipient: The mailed package contained instructions to send all subsequent monthly rent payments to Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina-registered business, at 231 Government Ave #3094, Hickory, NC 28602. This entity was not named or disclosed anywhere in the lease agreement. The package was mailed from Hickory, NC, further distancing the landlords from the transaction and obscuring the true recipient of the funds. This was not a mere oversight but a deliberate attempt to conceal the true nature of the financial transactions.
Pre-Addressed Envelopes: A Calculated Control Designed to Maintain Power: The package included eight pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes for the tenants to use for monthly payments to Amarlu Enterprises. The envelopes were addressed to the Hickory, NC address. These envelopes were intended for the eight monthly recurring payments between the first and last months of the lease, which were covered by the initial move-in costs. This pre-packaged system was designed to control the flow of payments and further obscure the true recipient of the funds. It was a calculated move to maintain power and control over the tenants.
Lease Address Discrepancy: A Blatant Misrepresentation Designed to Deceive: The lease agreement contained six address fields in total (five for "landlord address" and one for the rented property being leased, therefore the tenants address). The address stated for rental payment, and other items like maintenance requests, formal notices, etc. was an addresss inputted by the landlords. That address the landlords inputted for all five fields requiring a landlord address was inputted as: 2649 Tifton St. S. Gulfport, FL 33711. This address matches the tenant address, resulting in one address for all parties on the lease, a gross violation of Florida statutes. This blatant misrepresentation was a clear attempt to deceive the tenants and obscure the true identity of the landlords. It was a calculated move to create confusion and potentially exploit the tenants' vulnerability.
Luther Rollins, Jr.'s Email: An Implied Threat Designed to Intimidate: During this period, the tenants noted that Luther Rollins, Jr., was using the email address "luther2law@gmail.com" in communications. This email address was not disclosed during the initial lease negotiations and was not used by Luther Rollins, Jr., prior to the lease signing. The tenants recognized this email address as a clear indication that Luther was a lawyer, potentially creating a sense of intimidation and unequal power dynamics. It was a calculated move to exert psychological pressure on the tenants.
No Addendum: A Deliberate Omission Designed to Violate Legal Requirements: No addendum was drafted or executed by all four parties to formalize the substantial and material modification to the lease agreement, specifically the change in payment recipient from Luther J. Rollins, Jr., to Amarlu Enterprises. This deliberate omission was a clear violation of standard practice and a potential violation of Florida law. It was a calculated move to avoid legal scrutiny and maintain control over the financial transactions.
Pet Deposit: A Disregarded Obligation Designed to Unlawfully Retain Funds: The $500 pet deposit was never returned or noted in any communication and was discarded and treated like a pet fee. None of the claims in the claims on security deposit letter include any pet-related damages, highlighting the landlords' disregard for their contractual obligations and their intent to unlawfully retain the funds. It was a calculated move to exploit the tenants' vulnerability and disregard their contractual rights.
V. Key Observations, Potential Violations, and Red Flags: A Deliberate Pattern of Deception and Control

Lack of Transparency: A Deliberate Strategy to Obscure the Truth: The introduction of Amarlu Enterprises as the recipient of rent payments, without prior disclosure or a formal addendum to the lease, raises serious concerns about transparency and potential misrepresentation. This was not an oversight but a deliberate strategy to obscure the true recipient of the funds and create a false sense of security.
Realtor's Dual Role: A Conflict of Interest Designed to Prioritize Landlord Interests: Zach Steinberger's multiple roles as listing agent, rental agent, and de facto property manager create a potential conflict of interest and raise questions about his neutrality in the transaction. This conflict of interest allowed him to prioritize the landlords' interests over the tenants' and potentially obscure critical information. It was a calculated move to exploit the tenants' vulnerability and maintain control over the process.
Delayed Payment Instructions: A Calculated Imposition Designed to Create Undue Pressure: The late provision of payment instructions, just two days before the second month's rent was due, created undue pressure and set a precedent for future communication issues. This was not an oversight but a deliberate attempt to create a sense of urgency and potentially set the tenants up for failure. It was a calculated move to maintain power and control over the tenants.
Lease Address Discrepancy: A Blatant Misrepresentation Designed to Deceive: The lease agreement contained six address fields in total (five for "landlord address" and one for the rented property being leased, therefore the tenants address). The address stated for rental payment, and other items like maintenance requests, formal notices, etc. was an addresss inputted by the landlords. That address the landlords inputted for all five fields requiring a landlord address was inputted as: 2649 Tifton St. S. Gulfport, FL 33711. This address matches the tenant address, resulting in one address for all parties on the lease, a gross violation of Florida statutes. This blatant misrepresentation was a clear attempt to deceive the tenants and obscure the true identity of the landlords. It was a calculated move to create confusion and potentially exploit the tenants' vulnerability.
Luther's Email Address: An Implied Threat Designed to Intimidate: The use of "luther2law@gmail.com" by Luther Rollins, Jr., raises questions about his intent and whether he was attempting to project an image of legal authority. This was a calculated move to potentially intimidate the tenants and create an unequal power dynamic. It was a subtle but powerful form of psychological manipulation.
Statutory Non-Compliance: A Clear Violation Designed to Avoid Legal Scrutiny: The failure to provide a formal addendum to the lease agreement to reflect the change in payment recipient is a potential violation of Florida law. This was not an oversight but a deliberate disregard for legal requirements. It was a calculated move to avoid legal scrutiny and maintain control over the financial transactions.

## Lack of Fully Executed Lease: 

A Deviation from Standard Practice Designed to Obscure the Terms: The tenants were not provided with a fully executed copy of the lease at the time of signing, which is a deviation from standard practice and a potential attempt to obscure the terms of the agreement. It was a calculated move to maintain control over the lease and exploit the tenants' vulnerability.
Unreturned Pet Deposit: A Disregarded Obligation Designed to Unlawfully Retain Funds: The pet deposit was never returned or accounted for, despite the lease stating it was a deposit and not a fee. This was a clear disregard for the contractual obligations and a potential attempt to unlawfully retain the funds. It was a calculated move to exploit the tenants' vulnerability and disregard their contractual rights.

# VI. Conclusion: A Deliberate and Calculated Scheme of Deception and Control

The events leading up to and including the first day of the lease reveal a deliberate and calculated scheme of irregularities, potential misrepresentations, and violations. The lack of transparency, the introduction of an undisclosed third party for rent payments, the delayed payment instructions, the lease address discrepancy, the use of "luther2law@gmail.com," the lack of a fully executed lease, and the unreturned pet deposit all point to a problematic start to the tenancy. These issues laid the groundwork for the subsequent disputes and highlight the need for a thorough investigation into the landlords' and realtor's actions. This was not a series of isolated incidents but a deliberate and calculated strategy to deceive and control the tenants from the very beginning. This section serves as a powerful indictment of the landlords' and realtor's actions, setting the stage for a compelling legal case.

## Timeline of Intensive Harassment on October 29, 2024:

Over the course of approximately six hours, you escalated your pressure tactics, placing repeated phone calls and leaving multiple voicemails, each attempt separated by roughly two-hour intervals. After ignoring my standing request for written correspondence, you made two phone calls followed by two voicemails, all within a short timeframe. When I did not respond, you followed up with a text message, again approximately two hours later, thereby punctuating the day with a relentless cycle of unsolicited outreach.

### Quoted Text Message Written by Luther Rollins, Landlord:

After these repeated phone contacts and voicemails, you sent me the following text message on October 29, 2024:

> 	“Hi Stephen, I called you a couple times today to discuss the Tenant Response & Dispute you sent to me which I recently received. I hope we could talk (and I believe we are both supposed to) try to resolve amicably. I am available most days this week 9:00am-ish till about 10pm.”

In this message, you again attempt to frame the resolution process as something that supposedly mandates a phone call, stating “I believe we are both supposed to” engage in a verbal discussion. This is categorically untrue. Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 83.51, which govern security deposits and habitability, as well as §§715.10–715.111, which outline procedures for handling personal property, impose no requirement for phone calls, verbal negotiations, or live discussions. Your claim that “we are both supposed to” have a phone call severely misrepresents the law and seeks to corner me into a scenario where I would be at a disadvantage—“outmatched by a declared lawyer”—contrary to the transparency and fairness that the statutes intend.

### Impact and Legal Implications:
The repeated calls, voicemails, and now this text message—each separated by roughly two-hour intervals—display a calculated effort to erode my stance on written communication and push me into a verbally intimidating interaction. This calculated timing and insistence on a method never required by statute is a form of harassment. Your decision to leverage your attorney status, along with an email moniker implying legal expertise, only intensifies the coercive atmosphere.

### Conclusion:
These actions—excessive calling, repeated voicemails, and sending a misleading text message after a series of two-hour interval attempts—violate the principle of written, verifiable communication that Florida law heavily favors and I explicitly requested. By misrepresenting legal requirements and attempting to pressure me into a “phone call” that statutes do not mandate, you have crossed into harassment and bad-faith intimidation. This coercive behavior will not force me to abandon my legal rights or documented communication channels. Instead, it further solidifies my resolve to seek remedies permitted by Florida law, should you continue to flout statutory directives and proper dispute resolution procedures.

# Repetitive, Coercive Communications and Misrepresentation of Legal Requirements**

Your persistent attempts to coerce me into a phone call, despite my clear, written request for all communications to remain in writing, constitute a pattern of harassment—especially given your self-declared status as a “corporate attorney” and the intimidation factor introduced by your “luther2law” email address. Florida’s landlord-tenant statutes do not compel me to engage in phone discussions to resolve disputes or address your claims. Yet you continued to push for verbal contact, misrepresenting that the law requires such a step.
