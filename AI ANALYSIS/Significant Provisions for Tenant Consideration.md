# Significant Provisions for Tenant Consideration

## Financial Considerations

### High Initial Payment Requirement
- **Total Move-In Cost**: $14,000.00 required before occupancy
- **Impact**: This substantial upfront payment (equivalent to more than 3 months' rent) creates a significant financial barrier to entry
- **Consideration**: Tenant should ensure sufficient funds are available well before the move-in date

### Security Deposit Handling
- The lease does not explicitly state which of the three legally permitted methods the landlord will use to hold the security deposit:
  - Non-interest-bearing account
  - Interest-bearing account (with tenant receiving at least 75% of interest or 5% simple interest)
  - Surety bond
- **Consideration**: Tenant should request written clarification on how the security deposit will be held and whether interest will be paid

### Incomplete Maintenance Responsibility Allocation
- The maintenance responsibility section (Section 10) has many blank fields
- Only roofs and pest extermination are explicitly assigned to the landlord
- **Impact**: Ambiguity could lead to disputes over who is responsible for repairs and maintenance
- **Consideration**: Tenant should request written clarification on all maintenance responsibilities before signing

## Occupancy and Use Restrictions

### Renter's Insurance Requirement
- Tenant must carry renter's insurance (specified in Section 10)
- **Consideration**: Tenant should factor this ongoing cost into their budget and confirm coverage requirements

### Alterations Restriction
- Tenant may not paint or make alterations without landlord's written consent
- Exception: Tenant may hang pictures and install window treatments if they repair damage upon removal
- **Consideration**: Tenant should discuss any desired modifications before signing

### Pet Restrictions
- Only one dog is permitted with payment of $500 pet deposit
- **Consideration**: Tenant should confirm if there are any breed or size restrictions not explicitly stated

## Legal Vulnerabilities

### Incomplete Maintenance Terms
- The lease form has numerous blank spaces in the maintenance section
- **Impact**: This creates ambiguity about responsibility for critical systems (plumbing, electrical, HVAC)
- **Consideration**: Without clear assignment, tenant may face unexpected repair costs or maintenance disputes

### No Early Termination Provision
- The lease does not include an early termination fee option
- **Impact**: If tenant needs to break the lease early, they remain liable for rent until the end of the lease term or until the unit is re-rented
- **Consideration**: Tenant should understand their limited options if circumstances require relocation before lease end

### Automatic Subordination to Mortgages
- Lease is automatically subordinate to any mortgage on the property
- **Impact**: In case of foreclosure, tenant's rights may be affected
- **Consideration**: Tenant should research if there are any existing mortgage issues with the property

### Attorney's Fees Provision
- Prevailing party in any lawsuit can recover attorney's fees from the non-prevailing party
- **Impact**: Increases financial risk of any legal dispute
- **Consideration**: Tenant should be cautious about entering into disputes without strong legal grounds

## Administrative Concerns

### Unclear Notice Requirements
- While the lease specifies that notices to landlord must be given by U.S. mail or hand delivery, it doesn't specify required notice periods for various situations
- **Consideration**: Tenant should clarify notice requirements for maintenance requests, intent to vacate, etc.

### Tenant's Personal Property Clause
- Section 29 (not initialed) would have waived landlord's responsibility for tenant's personal property upon surrender, abandonment, or death
- **Consideration**: While not activated in this lease, tenant should be aware of the importance of this provision in future leases
