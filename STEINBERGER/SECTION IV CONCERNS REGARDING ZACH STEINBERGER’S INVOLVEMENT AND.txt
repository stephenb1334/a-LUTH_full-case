SECTION IV: CONCERNS REGARDING ZACH STEINBERGER’S INVOLVEMENT AND IMPARTIALITY

Dear Mr. Rollins,

This section addresses the problematic conduct of your associate, Mr. Zach Steinberger, whose actions and conflicting roles raise serious concerns about his impartiality and credibility in this matter. It is essential to understand that Mr. Steinberger’s involvement is not that of a neutral third party, but rather that of a biased agent, whose actions and opinions should be viewed with considerable skepticism.

A. Misrepresentation of Role and Authority:

Non-Paralegal Status: Mr. Steinberger has been presented as your "declared paralegal," a claim that is not substantiated [1-3]. In reality, he is a licensed real estate professional with Compass Florida LLC [4]. It is critical to clarify that Mr. Steinberger is not a paralegal as defined by Florida law and cannot claim to have the legal authority or expertise implied by such a designation [2]. His attempt to present himself as something he is not is a misrepresentation and is unethical [5].
Property Manager Role: In addition to being a realtor, Mr. Steinberger acted as your property manager and main point of contact [3]. This dual role compromises his ability to act as a neutral party in any dispute and creates a direct conflict of interest [2].
B. Conflicts of Interest:

Dual Agency: Mr. Steinberger served as both the listing agent when the property was for sale and the rental agent [3]. This dual role created a financial incentive for him to favor your interests over those of the tenant, thereby undermining his neutrality [3].
Financial Incentive: Mr. Steinberger's financial interests are directly tied to maintaining a positive relationship with you [3]. His commission depended on the successful sale or rental of the property, creating a bias to protect your interests, which could color his assessment of damages, and may explain his improper communication to me and failure to disclose pertinent information. His financial incentive to maintain a good relationship with you undermines his ability to act impartially [3].
Protecting Landlord: It appears that Mr. Steinberger was motivated to protect you from accountability, to preserve future business opportunities. This casts doubt on the objectivity of his opinions and actions regarding my security deposit and personal property [3].
Compromised Neutrality: As the agent responsible for securing me as a tenant, and also as the property manager, Mr. Steinberger is inherently a partial party in the disputes between you, as the landlord, and me, as the tenant, thus compromising his neutrality [3]. His financial incentive to maintain a good relationship with you, as the landlord, undermines his ability to act impartially [3].
C. Involvement in the Security Deposit and Personal Property Dispute:

Inventory List: Mr. Steinberger was responsible for collecting the inventory list [6, 7]. This list was never fully executed with signatures on both sides [6-8], nor was it attached as an addendum to the lease [6-9], rendering it legally unsound and inadmissible in substantiating any claims. He was aware that the inventory list was not in compliance with the lease, yet he used it anyway.
Damage Assessment: As a realtor, Mr. Steinberger is not a qualified professional to evaluate damages to the property, and his statements on this matter are nothing more than an amateur opinion that carries no professional weight [3]. His assessment of damages, therefore, lacks impartiality and professional credentials.
Null and Void Addendum: Given Mr. Steinberger's numerous conflicts of interest, any written statements by him regarding damages attached to your claim on security deposit should be deemed null and void [3].
D. Communication and Record Keeping

Failure to Share Communication: As a proxy and declared paralegal, Mr. Steinberger was under obligation to share all communication between myself and him with you [3]. His failure to do so demonstrates a gross oversight on both of your parts [3].
Required Communication Records: Both you and Mr. Steinberger are required to preserve all communication records, especially text messages, as these are crucial evidence [10-12]. Tampering with or destroying potential evidence in legal proceedings is unlawful. You are both under legal obligation to provide all communication, including text communication, from the first day of communication through the present, as well as any communication records that remain on the devices, apps, and servers for the devices. .
E. Ethical and Professional Concerns:

Florida Bar Rules & Misrepresentation: You and Mr. Steinberger's actions fall under ethical violations as outlined in Florida Bar Rule 4-7.13 [5]. If Mr. Steinberger was acting as a proxy paralegal for you and was representing you, while also misrepresenting himself to me, he may be engaging in deceptive representation which is prohibited [5].
NAR Code of Ethics Violations: Mr. Steinberger may have violated the National Association of Realtors (NAR) Code of Ethics, including Article 1, Article 11, and Article 12 [3]. Article 1 requires realtors to protect and promote the interests of their clients while being honest and fair with all parties. Article 11 requires realtors to perform only services for which they are qualified and to disclose conflicts of interest. Article 12 prohibits false or misleading statements about the condition of a property [3].
Compromised Testimony: Due to his multiple conflicts of interest and potential ethical breaches, Mr. Steinberger’s testimony should be viewed with skepticism. His dual roles may call into question his impartiality regarding tenant damages and the legitimacy of the inventory list he collected [3].
F. Conclusion:

Mr. Steinberger’s conduct demonstrates a pattern of conflicts of interest and potential breaches of ethical and professional standards. His dual roles, misrepresentation of his status, and involvement in the security deposit dispute all cast doubt on his credibility and impartiality. This undermines your position and further highlights the bad faith with which you have handled this matter. All actions and statements by Mr. Steinberger should be viewed with the understanding that they are not impartial and, as such, carry little weight without corroborating third-party evidence. It is also noteworthy that you, a licensed attorney, would allow such conflicts of interest to occur and even participate in their exploitation.

This detailed explanation of Mr. Steinberger’s involvement is intended to provide a clear legal basis for challenging his credibility and the validity of any claims he has made in this matter. I expect you to take these issues seriously and recognize the potential legal ramifications of your association with Mr. Steinberger.

License Jurisdiction Issue: Rollins is a licensed attorney in North Carolina, not Florida. Using an email address like “luther2law@gmail.com” in a Florida legal matter may mislead the tenant into believing he is authorized to practice law in Florida, potentially violating professional conduct standards.

Intimidation Tactics: By implying legal expertise or representation through his email and communications, Rollins may be engaging in unethical behavior aimed at intimidating or misleading the tenant, thereby exerting undue pressure during the dispute.

Evidence and Documentation Issues: The lack of proper documentation and evidence from Rollins severely undermines his claims, providing a stronger position for the tenant in any legal proceedings.



Emotional and Physical Impact: Claims related to harassment and emotional distress highlight the adverse effects of Rollins’ actions on the tenant’s well-being, potentially justifying claims for emotional damages.



Professional Ethical Concerns: As an attorney, Rollins’ alleged violations of the Florida Bar Rules amplify the severity of his misconduct, possibly leading to professional disciplinary actions in addition to tenant claims.



Conclusion:



This detailed breakdown of claims against Luther Rollins not only aligns with Florida’s legal framework but also presents a clear and organized case for the tenant’s position. By categorizing each allegation and providing specific instances of misconduct, the tenant can effectively demonstrate the breadth and depth of Rollins’ violations, thereby strengthening the case for restitution, compensation, and appropriate punitive measures.



By maintaining this structured and detailed format, you ensure that each claim is easily navigable and comprehensible, facilitating effective organization and presentation of your case.

Briefing Document: Boerner v. Rollins Landlord-Tenant Dispute

I. Overview

This document outlines a complex landlord-tenant dispute between Stephen Boerner (Tenant) and Luther J. Rollins Jr. (Landlord) concerning a property located at 2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL. The core of the dispute involves alleged violations of Florida Statutes related to security deposits, abandoned property, and habitability, along with claims of misrepresentation, negligence, emotional distress and harassment by the landlord. The tenant is pursuing legal action against the landlord.

II. Key Themes and Issues

Misrepresentation and "luther2law@gmail.com":
The landlord uses the email address "luther2law@gmail.com", creating an impression of being a practicing attorney. This could be a misrepresentation. "This could suggest an attempt to shield himself from scrutiny while retaining the benefits of appearing to be a lawyer. This inconsistency warrants closer examination."
If the landlord is not a practicing attorney, any claims he made while appearing to be one would constitute misrepresentation. "If Luther verbally claimed to be a lawyer during your tenancy, this could constitute misrepresentation under Florida law, especially if this claim influenced any decisions regarding your lease or dispute."
Improper Handling of Security Deposit (Fla. Stat. §83.49):
The landlord's initial claim on the security deposit lacked specific details and line items. "The first letter told me he was keeping $4,500 the full security deposit and provided no Basis or legally required detail and reasoning in the claim on security deposit."
The landlord did not provide information about the bank where the deposit was held, whether it was interest-bearing, or how many Florida properties he owns, all of which are required by law if he owns more than five. "Luther did not reply to certain items in my tenant dispute letter one of which was my request for him to declare how many Florida properties he had as a landlord... nor was I informed about my security deposit as in where it was being held and related details."
The tenant claims that the landlord improperly used potential future expenses or damage as a basis for security deposit deductions. "The letter spoke of repairs that would have to be done and clean up that would have to be made. Again, you wrote this letter on October 1, 2024 and you mailed it on October 2, 2024, but the property was listed for rent on October 5, 2024, so it’s clear to me that you used wording of future tense damages"
The tenant has made a request that the landlord confirms "whether my security deposit was placed in a separate bank account, and if so, whether the account is interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing, as per Florida Statute §83.49."
The tenant also requested, “The number of rental units you own or manage in the state of Florida”
Unlawful Retention and Conversion of Personal Property (Fla. Stat. §715.104):
The landlord failed to provide proper written notice about the personal property left behind, as required by Florida law. “...trust that he would provide me my 10 to 15 day window and provide me in writing a list of all of the belongings that he would consider abandoned Should I not reply to the issued letter siding, each individual piece of property and a timeframe to come pick it up? That is the statute as it is stated that was not followed."
"Under Florida Statute §715.104(1): > "After taking possession of the premises... the landlord shall give written notice to the former tenant... stating that the property is considered abandoned and that the landlord intends to dispose of it if not claimed."
The landlord advertised the property for rent, using the tenant's grill as a "barbecue" amenity which constitutes conversion. "I am confident that marketing a barbecue in reference to a grill that is mine and labeled in addendum B and marketing it in the form of using the word barbecue as a backyard amenity for this lease term, but did not use that terminology for the previous lease term when a grill did not exist in your backyard nor was it a amenity you marketed and I am confident the courts will see that as conversion."
The landlord's counter offer of $500 for the personal property "can serve as an implicit acknowledgment of liability."
The tenant states, "Luther tries to switch the burden of proof as it relates to belongings being left at his property, but I will reiterate that as of the writing of this letter and as of the writing of my previous letter sent in mid October, I am aware that my belongings are on the property Luther is attempting to shift the burden of proof to me, but it is his responsibility to prove that they were not there and are not there."
The landlord "accuses me of sending packages that were in my addendum B list to the property that he owns in Gulfport after the lease concluded but I can validate the shipping records that no package arrived after I vacated the property and packages that arrived towards the end of my Lease agreement are labeled an addendum B and are currently stored on the property by Luther."
Landlord Negligence and Breach of Warranty of Habitability (Fla. Stat. §83.51):
The landlord ignored an initial maintenance request for a clogged kitchen sink. "In October 2023, I encountered a severely clogged kitchen sink drain, rendering the left portion of the sink unusable.Action Taken: I promptly submitted a maintenance request.Your Response: There was no response or action taken on your part."
The landlord failed to address security issues after a break-in, including non functioning side gates and lack of security cameras. “I look to you to provide security in a home that you admitted had decaying side gates that allow the intruder to enter.” and "... you ignored my comments about the new fence gates that were needed that could actually latch and lock as the decayed fence gates did not lock let alone close completely."
The landlord gave permission for the tenant to install security cameras, but restricted the tenant from mounting them. "In other words you allowed me to find cameras that could not be fixed in any way shape or form to the physical structures on the property."
Emotional Distress and Harassment:
The tenant developed PTSD as a result of the break-in and the landlord's inaction regarding security concerns. "I developed PTSD due to threats that I received for retaliation that I kept between myself and my therapist."
The landlord engaged in frequent, unwanted phone calls and voicemails after the tenant requested communication via certified mail only. "Since Luther received my tenant dispute letter, he has called four times and left three voicemails... Luther tried to core me into phone calls, but I am not a lawyer and getting on the phone with him would be a disadvantage to me."
The tenant states the landlord's communications are “highly stressful and antagonize my PTSD, which can be validated with my therapist, corroborating by me, not issuing a response."
The tenant notes that unwanted communication, "should have ended communication attempts outside of the requested channels, but it continued."
The tenant notes that the landlord's communications were "antagonizing my condition."
Disputed Claims Regarding Property Damage:
The landlord's initial claim on the security deposit contained a "broadbrush stroke, Language and accusations as cited in my tenant dispute letter were incredibly omissive, which was coupled by an arrogance to just take what you want to take without following the state statute that protect the tenant landlord relationship"
The landlord claimed damage to walls, fixtures, excessive garbage and spoiled food. The tenant claims the issues were normal wear and tear or unusual circumstances. "No damage beyond normal wear and tear was caused. Florida law specifies that tenants are not responsible for normal wear and tear."
The tenant argues that the landlord's claims are based on future estimates, not actual documented damages, noting the landlord advertised the property for rent soon after move-out, suggesting repairs could not have been completed yet. “if you have these things how you state you do I invite you to look at the wording that you used in your claim on security deposit letter to me the wording that you used on October 1, 2024 when writing that letter spoke of the damages you would incur not the damages you did incur.”
The tenant cites the case, Johnson v. Baker, 388 So.2d 1056 (Fla. 4th DCA 1980), where "the court held that without evidence of the property's condition at the beginning of the tenancy, a landlord cannot prove that a tenant caused damages."
Arbitrary Settlement Offers and Shifting Burden of Proof:
The landlord's settlement offer of $500 for personal property and partial return of the security deposit is perceived as arbitrary. "I will not accept your offer that is arbitrarily made up without any degree of clarity and specificity as declared your responsibility by state mandated statutes."
The landlord is attempting to shift the burden of proof regarding the existence of the personal property when it's the landlord’s responsibility to prove the property was not present or abandoned. "Luther tries to switch the burden of proof as it relates to belongings being left at his property, but I will reiterate that as of the writing of this letter... I am aware that my belongings are on the property Luther is attempting to shift the burden of proof to me, but it is his responsibility to prove that they were not there and are not there."
The landlord is selectively quoting a text message to claim the tenant abandoned the property. "You selectively quoted my text to imply I abandoned my property. The full text states: “Hi Luther, I’m leaving town tonight indefinitely. It’s the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property. I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank you.” In context, this message reaffirms my intent to retrieve my possessions, not abandon them."
Additional Issues:
The tenant points out inconsistencies in the landlord's mailing address stating, "In his second letter, which is the response to my tenant dispute Luther uses a return address that includes “PO Box” whereas the first letter he did not which caused a delay in delivery of over one week as well as using the wrong ZIP Code in the first letter."
The lease agreement included "Zach Steinberger" as a point of contact for the landlord. The tenant reports that communication with Steinberger ceased and that the landlord requested direct contact.
The tenant cites, "the lease agreement where my tenant dispute" and the landlord did not meet the "legal obligations as lawyer, landlord, etc"
The tenant claims the landlord does not have street address services with the post office.

Okay, here is a detailed briefing document synthesizing the provided sources, focusing on the key themes, facts, and quotes.

Briefing Document: Boerner v. Rollins Landlord-Tenant Dispute

I. Overview

This document outlines a complex landlord-tenant dispute between Stephen Boerner (Tenant) and Luther J. Rollins Jr. (Landlord) concerning a property located at 2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL. The core of the dispute involves alleged violations of Florida Statutes related to security deposits, abandoned property, and habitability, along with claims of misrepresentation, negligence, emotional distress and harassment by the landlord. The tenant is pursuing legal action against the landlord.

II. Key Themes and Issues

Misrepresentation and "luther2law@gmail.com":
The landlord uses the email address "luther2law@gmail.com", creating an impression of being a practicing attorney. This could be a misrepresentation. "This could suggest an attempt to shield himself from scrutiny while retaining the benefits of appearing to be a lawyer. This inconsistency warrants closer examination."
If the landlord is not a practicing attorney, any claims he made while appearing to be one would constitute misrepresentation. "If Luther verbally claimed to be a lawyer during your tenancy, this could constitute misrepresentation under Florida law, especially if this claim influenced any decisions regarding your lease or dispute."
Improper Handling of Security Deposit (Fla. Stat. §83.49):
The landlord's initial claim on the security deposit lacked specific details and line items. "The first letter told me he was keeping $4,500 the full security deposit and provided no Basis or legally required detail and reasoning in the claim on security deposit."
The landlord did not provide information about the bank where the deposit was held, whether it was interest-bearing, or how many Florida properties he owns, all of which are required by law if he owns more than five. "Luther did not reply to certain items in my tenant dispute letter one of which was my request for him to declare how many Florida properties he had as a landlord... nor was I informed about my security deposit as in where it was being held and related details."
The tenant claims that the landlord improperly used potential future expenses or damage as a basis for security deposit deductions. "The letter spoke of repairs that would have to be done and clean up that would have to be made. Again, you wrote this letter on October 1, 2024 and you mailed it on October 2, 2024, but the property was listed for rent on October 5, 2024, so it’s clear to me that you used wording of future tense damages"
The tenant has made a request that the landlord confirms "whether my security deposit was placed in a separate bank account, and if so, whether the account is interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing, as per Florida Statute §83.49."
The tenant also requested, “The number of rental units you own or manage in the state of Florida”
Unlawful Retention and Conversion of Personal Property (Fla. Stat. §715.104):
The landlord failed to provide proper written notice about the personal property left behind, as required by Florida law. “...trust that he would provide me my 10 to 15 day window and provide me in writing a list of all of the belongings that he would consider abandoned Should I not reply to the issued letter siding, each individual piece of property and a timeframe to come pick it up? That is the statute as it is stated that was not followed."
"Under Florida Statute §715.104(1): > "After taking possession of the premises... the landlord shall give written notice to the former tenant... stating that the property is considered abandoned and that the landlord intends to dispose of it if not claimed."
The landlord advertised the property for rent, using the tenant's grill as a "barbecue" amenity which constitutes conversion. "I am confident that marketing a barbecue in reference to a grill that is mine and labeled in addendum B and marketing it in the form of using the word barbecue as a backyard amenity for this lease term, but did not use that terminology for the previous lease term when a grill did not exist in your backyard nor was it a amenity you marketed and I am confident the courts will see that as conversion."
The landlord's counter offer of $500 for the personal property "can serve as an implicit acknowledgment of liability."
The tenant states, "Luther tries to switch the burden of proof as it relates to belongings being left at his property, but I will reiterate that as of the writing of this letter and as of the writing of my previous letter sent in mid October, I am aware that my belongings are on the property Luther is attempting to shift the burden of proof to me, but it is his responsibility to prove that they were not there and are not there."
The landlord "accuses me of sending packages that were in my addendum B list to the property that he owns in Gulfport after the lease concluded but I can validate the shipping records that no package arrived after I vacated the property and packages that arrived towards the end of my Lease agreement are labeled an addendum B and are currently stored on the property by Luther."
Landlord Negligence and Breach of Warranty of Habitability (Fla. Stat. §83.51):
The landlord ignored an initial maintenance request for a clogged kitchen sink. "In October 2023, I encountered a severely clogged kitchen sink drain, rendering the left portion of the sink unusable.Action Taken: I promptly submitted a maintenance request.Your Response: There was no response or action taken on your part."
The landlord failed to address security issues after a break-in, including non functioning side gates and lack of security cameras. “I look to you to provide security in a home that you admitted had decaying side gates that allow the intruder to enter.” and "... you ignored my comments about the new fence gates that were needed that could actually latch and lock as the decayed fence gates did not lock let alone close completely."
The landlord gave permission for the tenant to install security cameras, but restricted the tenant from mounting them. "In other words you allowed me to find cameras that could not be fixed in any way shape or form to the physical structures on the property."
Emotional Distress and Harassment:
The tenant developed PTSD as a result of the break-in and the landlord's inaction regarding security concerns. "I developed PTSD due to threats that I received for retaliation that I kept between myself and my therapist."
The landlord engaged in frequent, unwanted phone calls and voicemails after the tenant requested communication via certified mail only. "Since Luther received my tenant dispute letter, he has called four times and left three voicemails... Luther tried to core me into phone calls, but I am not a lawyer and getting on the phone with him would be a disadvantage to me."
The tenant states the landlord's communications are “highly stressful and antagonize my PTSD, which can be validated with my therapist, corroborating by me, not issuing a response."
The tenant notes that unwanted communication, "should have ended communication attempts outside of the requested channels, but it continued."
The tenant notes that the landlord's communications were "antagonizing my condition."
Disputed Claims Regarding Property Damage:
The landlord's initial claim on the security deposit contained a "broadbrush stroke, Language and accusations as cited in my tenant dispute letter were incredibly omissive, which was coupled by an arrogance to just take what you want to take without following the state statute that protect the tenant landlord relationship"
The landlord claimed damage to walls, fixtures, excessive garbage and spoiled food. The tenant claims the issues were normal wear and tear or unusual circumstances. "No damage beyond normal wear and tear was caused. Florida law specifies that tenants are not responsible for normal wear and tear."
The tenant argues that the landlord's claims are based on future estimates, not actual documented damages, noting the landlord advertised the property for rent soon after move-out, suggesting repairs could not have been completed yet. “if you have these things how you state you do I invite you to look at the wording that you used in your claim on security deposit letter to me the wording that you used on October 1, 2024 when writing that letter spoke of the damages you would incur not the damages you did incur.”
The tenant cites the case, Johnson v. Baker, 388 So.2d 1056 (Fla. 4th DCA 1980), where "the court held that without evidence of the property's condition at the beginning of the tenancy, a landlord cannot prove that a tenant caused damages."
Arbitrary Settlement Offers and Shifting Burden of Proof:
The landlord's settlement offer of $500 for personal property and partial return of the security deposit is perceived as arbitrary. "I will not accept your offer that is arbitrarily made up without any degree of clarity and specificity as declared your responsibility by state mandated statutes."
The landlord is attempting to shift the burden of proof regarding the existence of the personal property when it's the landlord’s responsibility to prove the property was not present or abandoned. "Luther tries to switch the burden of proof as it relates to belongings being left at his property, but I will reiterate that as of the writing of this letter... I am aware that my belongings are on the property Luther is attempting to shift the burden of proof to me, but it is his responsibility to prove that they were not there and are not there."
The landlord is selectively quoting a text message to claim the tenant abandoned the property. "You selectively quoted my text to imply I abandoned my property. The full text states: “Hi Luther, I’m leaving town tonight indefinitely. It’s the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property. I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank you.” In context, this message reaffirms my intent to retrieve my possessions, not abandon them."
Additional Issues:
The tenant points out inconsistencies in the landlord's mailing address stating, "In his second letter, which is the response to my tenant dispute Luther uses a return address that includes “PO Box” whereas the first letter he did not which caused a delay in delivery of over one week as well as using the wrong ZIP Code in the first letter."
The lease agreement included "Zach Steinberger" as a point of contact for the landlord. The tenant reports that communication with Steinberger ceased and that the landlord requested direct contact.
The tenant cites, "the lease agreement where my tenant dispute" and the landlord did not meet the "legal obligations as lawyer, landlord, etc"
The tenant claims the landlord does not have street address services with the post office.

Briefing Document: Landlord-Tenant Dispute - Boerner v. Rollins

I. Overview

This briefing document outlines a complex landlord-tenant dispute between Stephen Boerner (Tenant) and Luther J. Rollins, Jr. (Landlord), primarily concerning the handling of a security deposit, personal property, and the breach of Florida Statutes. The tenant alleges that the landlord, who may or may not be a practicing lawyer, engaged in multiple violations, including misrepresentation, improper handling of security deposits and personal property, breach of the warranty of habitability, emotional distress and harassment of tenant. The tenant also disputes the claim of damages made by the landlord. The tenant is pursuing legal action, seeking not only compensatory damages but also statutory and punitive damages.

II. Key Themes and Issues

Misrepresentation and "luther2law@gmail.com":The landlord uses the email address "luther2law@gmail.com," which creates the impression of being a practicing attorney. This could be misrepresentation and an attempt to appear as an attorney without being one. "This could suggest an attempt to shield himself from scrutiny while retaining the benefits of appearing to be a lawyer. This inconsistency warrants closer examination."
If Luther is not a practicing attorney, any claims he made while appearing to be one would constitute misrepresentation. "If Luther verbally claimed to be a lawyer during your tenancy, this could constitute misrepresentation under Florida law, especially if this claim influenced any decisions regarding your lease or dispute."
Improper Handling of Security Deposit (Fla. Stat. §83.49):The initial claim on the security deposit lacked specific details and line items. "The first letter told me he was keeping $4,500 the full security deposit and provided no Basis or legally required detail and reasoning in the claim on security deposit."
The landlord failed to inform the tenant of where the security deposit was being held, whether it was interest-bearing, and how many Florida properties he owns, all of which are required by law if he owns more than five properties, all within 30 days of receiving the funds."Luther did not reply to certain items in my tenant dispute letter one of which was my request for him to declare how many Florida properties he had as a landlord... nor was I informed about my security deposit as in where it was being held and related details."
The tenant argues the landlord used future or potential expenses/damages as a basis for deductions, not actual expenses. "The letter spoke of repairs that would have to be done and clean up that would have to be made. Again, you wrote this letter on October 1, 2024 and you mailed it on October 2, 2024, but the property was listed for rent on October 5, 2024, so it’s clear to me that you used wording of future tense damages". The landlord's claim did not specify the nature or extent of the damage, making it a broad brush stroke.
The tenant has requested that the landlord confirm "whether my security deposit was placed in a separate bank account, and if so, whether the account is interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing, as per Florida Statute §83.49."
The tenant also requested, “The number of rental units you own or manage in the state of Florida”
Unlawful Retention and Conversion of Personal Property (Fla. Stat. §715.104):The landlord did not provide proper written notice about abandoned personal property, a violation of Florida law, citing that “...trust that he would provide me my 10 to 15 day window and provide me in writing a list of all of the belongings that he would consider abandoned Should I not reply to the issued letter siding, each individual piece of property and a timeframe to come pick it up? That is the statute as it is stated that was not followed."
"Under Florida Statute §715.104(1): > "After taking possession of the premises... the landlord shall give written notice to the former tenant... stating that the property is considered abandoned and that the landlord intends to dispose of it if not claimed."
The landlord advertised the property for rent, using the tenant's grill as a "barbecue" amenity which constitutes conversion. "I am confident that marketing a barbecue in reference to a grill that is mine and labeled in addendum B and marketing it in the form of using the word barbecue as a backyard amenity for this lease term, but did not use that terminology for the previous lease term when a grill did not exist in your backyard nor was it a amenity you marketed and I am confident the courts will see that as conversion."
The landlord's counter offer of $500 for the personal property "can serve as an implicit acknowledgment of liability."
The tenant states, "Luther tries to switch the burden of proof as it relates to belongings being left at his property, but I will reiterate that as of the writing of this letter and as of the writing of my previous letter sent in mid October, I am aware that my belongings are on the property Luther is attempting to shift the burden of proof to me, but it is his responsibility to prove that they were not there and are not there."
The landlord "accuses me of sending packages that were in my addendum B list to the property that he owns in Gulfport after the lease concluded but I can validate the shipping records that no package arrived after I vacated the property and packages that arrived towards the end of my Lease agreement are labeled an addendum B and are currently stored on the property by Luther."
Landlord Negligence and Breach of Warranty of Habitability (Fla. Stat. §83.51):The landlord ignored an initial maintenance request for a clogged kitchen sink. "In October 2023 , I encountered a severely clogged kitchen sink drain, rendering the left portion of the sink unusable. Action Taken: I promptly submitted a maintenance request. Your Response: There was no response or action taken on your part."
The landlord failed to address security issues after a break-in, including malfunctioning side gates and the lack of security cameras. “I look to you to provide security in a home that you admitted had decaying side gates that allow the intruder to enter.” and "... you ignored my comments about the new fence gates that were needed that could actually latch and lock as the decayed fence gates did not lock let alone close completely."
The landlord gave permission for the tenant to install security cameras, but restricted the tenant from mounting them. "In other words you allowed me to find cameras that could not be fixed in any way shape or form to the physical structures on the property."
Emotional Distress and Harassment:The tenant developed PTSD as a result of the break-in and the landlord's inaction regarding security concerns. "I developed PTSD due to threats that I received for retaliation that I kept between myself and my therapist."
The landlord engaged in frequent, unwanted phone calls and voicemails after the tenant requested communication via certified mail only. "Since Luther received my tenant dispute letter, he has called four times and left three voicemails... Luther tried to core me into phone calls, but I am not a lawyer and getting on the phone with him would be a disadvantage to me."
The tenant states the landlord's communications are “highly stressful and antagonize my PTSD, which can be validated with my therapist, corroborating by me, not issuing a response."
The tenant notes that unwanted communication, "should have ended communication attempts outside of the requested channels, but it continued."
The tenant notes that the landlord's communications were "antagonizing my condition."
Disputed Claims Regarding Property Damage:The landlord's initial claim on the security deposit contained a "broadbrush stroke, Language and accusations as cited in my tenant dispute letter were incredibly omissive, which was coupled by an arrogance to just take what you want to take without following the state statute that protect the tenant landlord relationship"
The landlord claimed damages to walls, fixtures, excessive garbage, and spoiled food. The tenant claims the issues were normal wear and tear or unusual circumstances. "No damage beyond normal wear and tear was caused. Florida law specifies that tenants are not responsible for normal wear and tear."
The tenant argues that the landlord's claims are based on future estimates, not actual documented damages, noting the landlord advertised the property for rent soon after move-out, suggesting repairs could not have been completed yet. “if you have these things how you state you do I invite you to look at the wording that you used in your claim on security deposit letter to me the wording that you used on October 1, 2024 when writing that letter spoke of the damages you would incur not the damages you did incur.”
The tenant cites the case, Johnson v. Baker, 388 So.2d 1056 (Fla. 4th DCA 1980), where "the court held that without evidence of the property's condition at the beginning of the tenancy, a landlord cannot prove that a tenant caused damages."
Arbitrary Settlement Offers and Shifting Burden of Proof:The landlord's settlement offer of $500 for personal property and partial return of the security deposit is seen as arbitrary. "I will not accept your offer that is arbitrarily made up without any degree of clarity and specificity as declared your responsibility by state mandated statutes."
The landlord is attempting to shift the burden of proof regarding the existence of the personal property when it is the landlord's responsibility to prove the property was not present or abandoned. "Luther tries to switch the burden of proof as it relates to belongings being left at his property, but I will reiterate that as of the writing of this letter... I am aware that my belongings are on the property Luther is attempting to shift the burden of proof to me, but it is his responsibility to prove that they were not there and are not there."
III. Legal Arguments and Potential Damages

The tenant is pursuing legal action against the landlord based on multiple violations of Florida law, including:

Florida Statute §83.49: Violations regarding improper handling of the security deposit.
Florida Statute §715.104: Violations regarding improper handling of abandoned personal property and conversion of property.
Florida Statute §83.51: Violations regarding the landlord's duty to maintain the premises and breach of the warranty of habitability, including security issues and failure to repair.
Florida Statute §83.67: Prohibited practices of converting the tenant's personal property.
Florida Statute §784.048: Stalking, arising from unwanted communications.
Potential for misrepresentation charges if landlord acted under pretense of being a lawyer while not actually practicing.
Potential for violations of Florida Statute §605.0902 if the landlord is conducting business in Florida without properly registering as a foreign entity.
Types of Damages the Tenant is Seeking:

Compensatory Damages: $8,710.62
Statutory Damages: $4,500
Treble Damages: Up to $26,131.86
Punitive Damages: Up to $26,131.86
Emotional Distress Damages: $10,000 to $50,000
Consequential Damages: $3,500 to $5,500
Statutory Conversion Damages: Up to $8,421.24
General/Nominal Damages: $1,000 to $2,000
Total potential damages could be as high as $108,394.58.

IV. Key Evidence and Supporting Facts

Lease Agreement: Signed lease confirming the landlord-tenant relationship, the terms of the lease, and acknowledgment that the lease is governed by Florida Statutes Chapter 83.
Security Deposit: The amount of security deposit paid ($4,500).
Tenant Dispute Letter: Document outlining the landlord's initial claim on security deposit letter and tenant's claims and dispute.
Correspondence: Two response letters from the landlord and the tenant’s response to the landlord.
Text Messages: Communications between the tenant and landlord relating to property maintenance, a break-in, and other issues.
Text messages show that the landlord was aware of the security issues.
Text messages show that landlord was informed of a home invasion and his response was not compliant to the safety and security of his tenants, including a request to install security cameras (with restrictions).
Text messages document landlord's acknowledgement of a clogged sink and not addressing the issue.
Text messages from a tenant stating, “Likewise, Luther. Thank you for being a great landlord. Talk soon," and shortly after text messages regarding a break-in and further correspondence about security gates, and the utility easement.
Text messages regarding the rent check being sent.
Addendum B: List of the personal property the tenant claims was left at the premises.
Property Listing: Evidence of the property being advertised for rent using the tenant's personal grill as a "barbecue" amenity.
Shipping Records: Proof that no packages were sent after the tenant vacated the property.
Brian Borland Police Records: Documentation of criminal history of the man who broke into the premises, as context for the tenant's fear and distress. This man is a known repeat offender with a history of violence and substance abuse, making the lack of security on the property a major concern.
Therapist's Verification: Confirmation of the tenant’s PTSD diagnosis, which was exacerbated by the landlord's actions and inactions.
Case Law: The tenant's case is supported by cases such as Johnson v. Baker, Durene v. Alcime, Williams v. Edwards, Goodwin v. Alexatos, and Fipps v. Robinson, which reinforce their arguments about the need for proper documentation, adherence to statutory procedures, and liability for conversion.
V. Landlord's Position

The landlord maintains that the personal property was abandoned and that he has not converted or sold any property he believed was left behind. He also argues that the security deposit was used to cover damages to the property and that he is not liable for emotional distress caused by the break-in. He states that he has photos of the premises before and after the tenancy and witnesses to damages caused by the tenant. However, the landlord has not provided evidence. The landlord offered a settlement of $500.00 for personal property and a partial refund of the security deposit, but did not provide reasoning for his calculations.

VI. Tenant's Rebuttal to Landlord's Position

The tenant disputes that their property was abandoned stating they were not given a timeline nor proper written notice.
The tenant claims that the landlord failed to document all claims on the security deposit within the 30 days required by statute, and failed to state where the security deposit was held, interest or non-interest bearing, and if he owned more than five properties in the State of Florida.
The tenant argues that the claims of damage were not based on actual costs but were estimated future costs.
The tenant argues the use of their personal property in marketing the unit is, in fact, conversion.
The tenant asserts that the landlord has not provided any documented evidence to substantiate their claims.
VII. Conclusion

This case presents a strong legal case for the tenant. The landlord's actions and inactions appear to be in violation of multiple Florida Statutes, and he has failed to document any of his claims of damage or abandonment. The tenant has a strong argument for the recovery of their security deposit and compensation for personal property. Given the evidence, the potential exposure for the landlord is substantial. The tenant is actively preparing to pursue litigation, and is prepared to bring forth not only the violations of statutes but also claims related to misrepresentation and fraud. The tenant has expressed a desire to hold the landlord accountable not just in the court of law, but with regulatory authorities and professional bodies governing his alleged legal career.

VIII. Recommendations

Continue to gather and preserve all relevant documentation.
Prepare for potential litigation with all evidence available.
Reiterate that all communication is to be done in writing via certified mail.
Be prepared to counter the Landlord's claims with evidence and specific case law.

FAQ: Landlord-Tenant Dispute in Florida
1. What are the landlord's obligations regarding the security deposit under Florida law?
Florida Statute §83.49 dictates that landlords must adhere to strict protocols concerning security deposits. If a landlord owns or manages five or more rental units, they must inform the tenant, within 30 days of receiving the deposit, of the location where the deposit is held, including whether it's in a separate bank account, and if it's interest-bearing or non-interest bearing. Additionally, within 30 days after the tenant vacates the property, the landlord is required to provide an itemized list of damages claimed against the deposit. This notice must be detailed and specify the reasons for each deduction and the respective amounts. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in the landlord forfeiting their right to make a claim against the deposit and being liable for the return of the deposit to the tenant.

2. How does Florida law define the handling of abandoned tenant property, and what steps must a landlord take?
Florida Statute §715.104 governs how landlords should handle abandoned personal property. After a tenant vacates the premises, the landlord must send written notice to the tenant, stating that any remaining property is considered abandoned and that the landlord intends to dispose of it if not claimed within a specified time frame. This notice must include a detailed list of the abandoned property and a timeline for the tenant to reclaim it. Simply deeming property abandoned without proper notification can be a violation of the statute and can lead to claims of conversion. A landlord cannot just assume the property is abandoned based on a text message from the tenant stating their intent to leave indefinitely. The landlord is responsible for providing the tenant with a window of time and an itemized list, so that the tenant can make arrangements to retrieve their belongings.

3. What constitutes "conversion" of personal property by a landlord, and what are the potential legal consequences?
Conversion occurs when a landlord uses a tenant's personal property as their own without authorization. This includes instances like disposing of, using, or selling a tenant's belongings, for example, advertising a rental property with the tenant's grill as a "barbecue" amenity. A landlord’s attempt to sell or use tenant's property without providing required statutory notice is illegal. According to Florida common law and §83.67(5) this could lead to claims for conversion under Florida law. If a court finds that the landlord converted a tenant’s property, the tenant is entitled to recover the value of the property. They could also be awarded punitive damages, especially if the conversion was willful and unlawful. Florida law allows for statutory damages for conversion, potentially doubling the value of the property. There could also be an awarding of treble damages which could result in the multiplying of the value by 3.

4. What are a landlord's responsibilities to maintain a safe and habitable premises, and what happens if those responsibilities are not met?
According to Florida Statute §83.51, landlords are legally obligated to keep their properties in habitable condition. This includes complying with all relevant building, housing, and health codes. Landlords must maintain plumbing and electrical systems in good working order, provide reasonable locks and keys, and make necessary repairs in a timely manner. If a landlord fails to address maintenance issues like clogged drains or necessary security issues after a break-in (e.g. broken gates or failing to provide security cameras) it can be considered a breach of the warranty of habitability. Tenants have recourse in such situations, such as seeking damages for any harm or loss experienced due to the landlord's negligence. The failure to keep the property in proper repair has the potential to make a landlord liable for statutory and general damages.

5. What types of damages can a tenant seek in a landlord-tenant dispute in Florida?
Tenants in Florida can pursue multiple types of damages in landlord-tenant disputes:

Compensatory Damages: Cover the actual financial losses due to the landlord's actions (e.g., cost to replace damaged property, value of converted items).
Statutory Damages: Penalties specified by law for violating certain statutes (e.g., improper handling of security deposits, conversion of property). These can include doubling the amount of the security deposit or the value of the converted property.
Punitive Damages: Aim to punish malicious or egregious conduct by the landlord and deter future misconduct. These are capped at three times the compensatory damages or $500,000, whichever is lower.
Treble Damages: For compensatory claims related to conversion, the amount can be multiplied by three.
Emotional Distress Damages: Compensation for mental anguish caused by the landlord's actions, such as the stress caused by a break-in, and subsequent disregard for the tenants well being.
General or Nominal Damages: Minimal amounts awarded when rights were violated, but no substantial financial loss was proven.
6. Can a landlord's offer to settle be seen as an admission of guilt, and how can a settlement be evaluated?
A landlord's counter offer, such as offering $500 for personal property, can be seen as an implicit acknowledgment of liability and can be used as evidence in court. It doesn't necessarily mean guilt, but can imply that there is at least some form of compensation due. When evaluating settlement offers, it is essential to look at the details. For example, when the landlord does not provide a breakdown or rationale for amounts it can be considered arbitrary. Arbitrary offers that do not adhere to relevant Florida statutes are invalid. It’s important to consider the full amount of damages you are entitled to as well as the circumstances around how the settlement offer was created and if it was done in good faith.

7. What actions by a landlord constitute harassment, and what legal avenues are available to a tenant experiencing harassment?
Harassment includes actions that cause emotional distress or are intended to intimidate a tenant. It includes actions like unwanted phone calls or voicemails that occur after the tenant has made it clear that the sole method of communication should be via certified mail. Florida Statute §784.048 defines stalking and prohibits conduct that causes substantial emotional distress without legitimate purpose. Additionally, a landlord cannot abuse their right to access a unit in order to harass a tenant. In instances of severe emotional distress that have been exacerbated by a landlord's actions, a tenant may pursue legal actions.

8. How does the use of "luther2law@gmail.com" by a landlord potentially impact a tenant's legal case, and what are the legal implications?
Using an email like "luther2law@gmail.com" may create the impression that the landlord is a practicing attorney. If the landlord is not a practicing attorney, this could be seen as a misrepresentation. If claims were made while appearing to be a lawyer, this could be seen as a misrepresentation under Florida law, especially if this claim influenced any decisions regarding the lease or dispute. Such misrepresentations could undermine the landlord's credibility in court and may lead to additional legal scrutiny. It is pertinent to ascertain if the landlord is indeed a licensed attorney to assess the validity of actions undertaken under the guise of legal expertise.




Okay, here's a formal section for a legal letter to Luther Rollins, detailing the issues with Zach Steinberger, drawing from the sources and our conversation history, formatted for clarity and impact:

SECTION IV: CONCERNS REGARDING ZACH STEINBERGER’S INVOLVEMENT AND IMPARTIALITY

Dear Mr. Rollins,

This section addresses the problematic conduct of your associate, Mr. Zach Steinberger, whose actions and conflicting roles raise serious concerns about his impartiality and credibility in this matter. It is essential to understand that Mr. Steinberger’s involvement is not that of a neutral third party, but rather that of a biased agent, whose actions and opinions should be viewed with considerable skepticism.

A. Misrepresentation of Role and Authority:

Non-Paralegal Status: Mr. Steinberger has been presented as your "declared paralegal," a claim that is not substantiated [1-3]. In reality, he is a licensed real estate professional with Compass Florida LLC [4]. It is critical to clarify that Mr. Steinberger is not a paralegal as defined by Florida law and cannot claim to have the legal authority or expertise implied by such a designation [2]. His attempt to present himself as something he is not is a misrepresentation and is unethical [5].
Property Manager Role: In addition to being a realtor, Mr. Steinberger acted as your property manager and main point of contact [3]. This dual role compromises his ability to act as a neutral party in any dispute and creates a direct conflict of interest [2].
B. Conflicts of Interest:

Dual Agency: Mr. Steinberger served as both the listing agent when the property was for sale and the rental agent [3]. This dual role created a financial incentive for him to favor your interests over those of the tenant, thereby undermining his neutrality [3].
Financial Incentive: Mr. Steinberger's financial interests are directly tied to maintaining a positive relationship with you [3]. His commission depended on the successful sale or rental of the property, creating a bias to protect your interests, which could color his assessment of damages, and may explain his improper communication to me and failure to disclose pertinent information. His financial incentive to maintain a good relationship with you undermines his ability to act impartially [3].
Protecting Landlord: It appears that Mr. Steinberger was motivated to protect you from accountability, to preserve future business opportunities. This casts doubt on the objectivity of his opinions and actions regarding my security deposit and personal property [3].
Compromised Neutrality: As the agent responsible for securing me as a tenant, and also as the property manager, Mr. Steinberger is inherently a partial party in the disputes between you, as the landlord, and me, as the tenant, thus compromising his neutrality [3]. His financial incentive to maintain a good relationship with you, as the landlord, undermines his ability to act impartially [3].
C. Involvement in the Security Deposit and Personal Property Dispute:

Inventory List: Mr. Steinberger was responsible for collecting the inventory list [6, 7]. This list was never fully executed with signatures on both sides [6-8], nor was it attached as an addendum to the lease [6-9], rendering it legally unsound and inadmissible in substantiating any claims. He was aware that the inventory list was not in compliance with the lease, yet he used it anyway.
Damage Assessment: As a realtor, Mr. Steinberger is not a qualified professional to evaluate damages to the property, and his statements on this matter are nothing more than an amateur opinion that carries no professional weight [3]. His assessment of damages, therefore, lacks impartiality and professional credentials.
Null and Void Addendum: Given Mr. Steinberger's numerous conflicts of interest, any written statements by him regarding damages attached to your claim on security deposit should be deemed null and void [3].
D. Communication and Record Keeping

Failure to Share Communication: As a proxy and declared paralegal, Mr. Steinberger was under obligation to share all communication between myself and him with you [3]. His failure to do so demonstrates a gross oversight on both of your parts [3].
Required Communication Records: Both you and Mr. Steinberger are required to preserve all communication records, especially text messages, as these are crucial evidence [10-12]. Tampering with or destroying potential evidence in legal proceedings is unlawful. You are both under legal obligation to provide all communication, including text communication, from the first day of communication through the present, as well as any communication records that remain on the devices, apps, and servers for the devices. .
E. Ethical and Professional Concerns:

Florida Bar Rules & Misrepresentation: You and Mr. Steinberger's actions fall under ethical violations as outlined in Florida Bar Rule 4-7.13 [5]. If Mr. Steinberger was acting as a proxy paralegal for you and was representing you, while also misrepresenting himself to me, he may be engaging in deceptive representation which is prohibited [5].
NAR Code of Ethics Violations: Mr. Steinberger may have violated the National Association of Realtors (NAR) Code of Ethics, including Article 1, Article 11, and Article 12 [3]. Article 1 requires realtors to protect and promote the interests of their clients while being honest and fair with all parties. Article 11 requires realtors to perform only services for which they are qualified and to disclose conflicts of interest. Article 12 prohibits false or misleading statements about the condition of a property [3].
Compromised Testimony: Due to his multiple conflicts of interest and potential ethical breaches, Mr. Steinberger’s testimony should be viewed with skepticism. His dual roles may call into question his impartiality regarding tenant damages and the legitimacy of the inventory list he collected [3].
F. Conclusion:

Mr. Steinberger’s conduct demonstrates a pattern of conflicts of interest and potential breaches of ethical and professional standards. His dual roles, misrepresentation of his status, and involvement in the security deposit dispute all cast doubt on his credibility and impartiality. This undermines your position and further highlights the bad faith with which you have handled this matter. All actions and statements by Mr. Steinberger should be viewed with the understanding that they are not impartial and, as such, carry little weight without corroborating third-party evidence. It is also noteworthy that you, a licensed attorney, would allow such conflicts of interest to occur and even participate in their exploitation.

This detailed explanation of Mr. Steinberger’s involvement is intended to provide a clear legal basis for challenging his credibility and the validity of any claims he has made in this matter. I expect you to take these issues seriously and recognize the potential legal ramifications of your association with Mr. Steinberger.

Okay, here is a detailed briefing document synthesizing the provided sources, focusing on the key themes, facts, and quotes.

Briefing Document: Boerner v. Rollins Landlord-Tenant Dispute

I. Overview

This document outlines a complex landlord-tenant dispute between Stephen Boerner (Tenant) and Luther J. Rollins Jr. (Landlord) concerning a property located at 2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL. The core of the dispute involves alleged violations of Florida Statutes related to security deposits, abandoned property, and habitability, along with claims of misrepresentation, negligence, emotional distress and harassment by the landlord. The tenant is pursuing legal action against the landlord.

II. Key Themes and Issues

Misrepresentation and "luther2law@gmail.com":
The landlord uses the email address "luther2law@gmail.com", creating an impression of being a practicing attorney. This could be a misrepresentation. "This could suggest an attempt to shield himself from scrutiny while retaining the benefits of appearing to be a lawyer. This inconsistency warrants closer examination."
If the landlord is not a practicing attorney, any claims he made while appearing to be one would constitute misrepresentation. "If Luther verbally claimed to be a lawyer during your tenancy, this could constitute misrepresentation under Florida law, especially if this claim influenced any decisions regarding your lease or dispute."
Improper Handling of Security Deposit (Fla. Stat. §83.49):
The landlord's initial claim on the security deposit lacked specific details and line items. "The first letter told me he was keeping $4,500 the full security deposit and provided no Basis or legally required detail and reasoning in the claim on security deposit."
The landlord did not provide information about the bank where the deposit was held, whether it was interest-bearing, or how many Florida properties he owns, all of which are required by law if he owns more than five. "Luther did not reply to certain items in my tenant dispute letter one of which was my request for him to declare how many Florida properties he had as a landlord... nor was I informed about my security deposit as in where it was being held and related details."
The tenant claims that the landlord improperly used potential future expenses or damage as a basis for security deposit deductions. "The letter spoke of repairs that would have to be done and clean up that would have to be made. Again, you wrote this letter on October 1, 2024 and you mailed it on October 2, 2024, but the property was listed for rent on October 5, 2024, so it’s clear to me that you used wording of future tense damages"
The tenant has made a request that the landlord confirms "whether my security deposit was placed in a separate bank account, and if so, whether the account is interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing, as per Florida Statute §83.49."
The tenant also requested, “The number of rental units you own or manage in the state of Florida”
Unlawful Retention and Conversion of Personal Property (Fla. Stat. §715.104):
The landlord failed to provide proper written notice about the personal property left behind, as required by Florida law. “...trust that he would provide me my 10 to 15 day window and provide me in writing a list of all of the belongings that he would consider abandoned Should I not reply to the issued letter siding, each individual piece of property and a timeframe to come pick it up? That is the statute as it is stated that was not followed."
"Under Florida Statute §715.104(1): > "After taking possession of the premises... the landlord shall give written notice to the former tenant... stating that the property is considered abandoned and that the landlord intends to dispose of it if not claimed."
The landlord advertised the property for rent, using the tenant's grill as a "barbecue" amenity which constitutes conversion. "I am confident that marketing a barbecue in reference to a grill that is mine and labeled in addendum B and marketing it in the form of using the word barbecue as a backyard amenity for this lease term, but did not use that terminology for the previous lease term when a grill did not exist in your backyard nor was it a amenity you marketed and I am confident the courts will see that as conversion."
