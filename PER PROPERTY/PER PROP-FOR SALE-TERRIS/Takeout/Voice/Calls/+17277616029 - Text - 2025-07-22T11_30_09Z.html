<q>He asked about:<br><br>- current competitive interest as he is pushing to close the sale of the Delaware primary residence . If you did not get that info, please don‚Äôt follow up for that alone. Not priority.<br><br>- Barry reviewed sellers disclosure documents in full , but didn‚Äôt elaborate on anything specific other than requesting your insights and if you spotted anything out of the ordinary across the seven documents and across public access info not disclosed (I‚Äôm unsure what that means thought maybe you might) <br><br>- and if you reviewed by cursory review, partial review, or in depth, he wondered if you believe all is standard protocol and no irregularities or cautionary advice or outside of a standard property inspection do you advise anything like a lead paint inspection as it doesn‚Äôt appear to Barry that ever took place and according to Barry a home built in 1955 is most likely to have it and may at no fault to the current owner who simply may never have had it checked since they purchased in 2022 and remain unaware of lead paint per the disclosure box they checked <br><br>None of these require follow up on with seller agent per Barry he prefers to collect all questions and requests to batch request it to seller and seller agent to save everyone many back and forth</q>

<q>He was also underwhelmed by the list of ‚Äúfor sale with property‚Äù list. He specifically said don‚Äôt ask you to go asking seller agent any follows up on the list details until he decides to ditch the real property offered as part of the deed transfer. He said washer and dryer should be standard already with the same not in addition to but I‚Äôm unsure. He also said outdoor furniture and cooking gear , tables , chairs, etc was of interest, but none of it included again. Please don‚Äôt ask for that information until we circle up together, but I‚Äôm giving you all the notes I have right now.</q>

<q>Hi Stanley,<br>We handle quite a few of these transactions where the furniture remains with the property. Just to clarify, the furniture can&#39;t be included in the real property sale‚Äîit has to be handled separately, off the contract. Typically, we just leave it off the agreement altogether.<br><br>That said, the washer and dryer, refrigerator, oven, and dishwasher are considered part of the real property and will stay with the home.<br><br>In the meantime, I‚Äôll start pulling permits to see what‚Äôs been done to the property, and I‚Äôll also check public records to get a clearer picture of anything else going on with it.<br><br>We‚Äôve also completed a comparative market analysis, and based on current market conditions, we believe the home should be valued between $530,000 and $540,000 as-is. This valuation reflects the house alone‚Äîthe furniture is not factored into that estimate.<br><br>Let me know if you have any questions on how we‚Äôll structure it or if you&#39;d like to go over the comps together.<br>Best of wish for your test<br><br>Terris</q>

<q>In Florida, using an ‚ÄúAs‚ÄëIs Residential Contract‚Äù simply means the property is sold in its current condition, and the seller isn‚Äôt obligated to make any repairs before closing  .<br><br>üîç Key Legal Highlights<br><br>1. Seller Responsibility and Disclosures<br><br>While sellers don‚Äôt have to fix anything, they must still disclose known material defects (like roofing leaks or termite damage)  .<br><br>This disclosure duty protects buyers from surprises and is required by Florida law‚Äîeven in ‚Äúas-is‚Äù sales  .<br><br><br>2. Inspection Rights &amp; Option to Withdraw<br><br>Buyers get a set inspection window (usually 10‚Äì15 calendar days) to evaluate the property  .<br><br>If they find issues they can‚Äôt accept, buyers can either negotiate a lower price or walk away‚Äîdeposit refunded‚Äîwithin that period  .<br><br><br>3. No Repair Mandate<br><br>Unlike standard contracts, the &quot;as-is&quot; form removes repair contingencies entirely  .<br><br>Buyers bear full responsibility for any repairs‚Äîeven if the lender requires them  .<br><br><br>4. Strong Buyer Protections Pre‚ÄëClosing<br><br>The contract provides a buyer-friendly inspection cancellation right, exercised in their ‚Äúsole discretion‚Äù, allowing them to recover earnest money with no penalty  .<br><br>This gives buyers peace of mind in an otherwise non-repairable sale.</q>
