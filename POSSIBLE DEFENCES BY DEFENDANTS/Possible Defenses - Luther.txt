# POSSIBLE DEFENSE STRATEGIES OF: THE LANDLORD (Luther & Mary), AMARLU ENTERPRISES, ZACH STEINBERGER, & COMPASS FLORIDA LLC


## LANDLORD DEFENSE STRATEGIES (Luther & Mary): 

### RETROACTIVE REGISTRATION

1. Retroactive Registration Under Florida Statutes §605.0902

Florida law allows foreign LLCs (e.g., Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina entity) to register retroactively to bring themselves into compliance with the law. This means that even if the entity was not registered during the lease term, it can file for registration after the fact, and once approved:
	•	The entity is authorized to transact business in Florida moving forward.
	•	The registration can apply retroactively, meaning the entity is treated as if it had been authorized during the period it was operating without registration.

What Retroactive Registration Does:
	•	Allows Enforcement of Contracts: Once registered, a foreign entity can enforce contracts and defend itself in Florida courts (e.g., by responding to lawsuits or filing counterclaims).
	•	Prevents Additional Penalties: By registering retroactively, the entity may avoid certain penalties for failing to register on time, such as fines imposed by the Florida Department of State.

2. Limits of Retroactive Registration

While retroactive registration provides certain benefits, it does not absolve the entity of liability for violations that occurred while it was unregistered. Florida law is clear:
	•	§605.0904(2): Even if the entity registers retroactively, it cannot avoid liability for any acts or omissions that occurred while unregistered.
	•	This includes:
	•	Tax evasion or avoidance: Any revenue generated by Amarlu Enterprises during the lease term (e.g., rental income) remains subject to Florida tax law.
	•	Claims of fraud, misrepresentation, or statutory violations: Retroactive registration does not shield the entity from lawsuits or damages arising from unlawful conduct during the unregistered period.

3. How Retroactive Registration Could Be Used as a Strategy

If you raise the issue of Amarlu Enterprises’ lack of registration in Florida in your next letter, Luther could potentially take steps to retroactively register the company to strengthen his defense. Here’s how that might work:
	1.	Filing Retroactively:
	•	Luther could file for retroactive registration of Amarlu Enterprises with the Florida Department of State.
	•	Once registered, the company would gain standing to enforce contracts or defend itself in court.
	2.	Using Retroactive Registration in Court:
	•	Luther might argue that retroactive registration means the company was “treated as compliant” during the lease term.
	•	He could attempt to shift liability from himself personally to the company, using the retroactive registration to claim that Amarlu Enterprises, not Luther and Mary, was the landlord.
	3.	Potential Impact on Damages:
	•	While retroactive registration allows Amarlu Enterprises to participate in legal proceedings, it does not erase prior violations of Florida law.
	•	However, Luther may use it as a tactic to argue that you are pursuing claims against the wrong party (him personally) and that any liability should lie solely with the now-registered company, potentially diluting his personal liability.

4. Why Retroactive Registration Would Likely Fail to Protect Luther in Your Case

Even if Luther registers Amarlu Enterprises retroactively, the following key facts undermine his ability to use this as a defense:

(a) Amarlu Enterprises Is Not Named on the Lease
	•	The lease names Luther Rollins and Mary Polk as landlords, not Amarlu Enterprises. Retroactive registration does not change this fundamental fact.
	•	Under Florida law, only the parties explicitly named in the lease are responsible for fulfilling its obligations. Amarlu Enterprises cannot retroactively “insert itself” into the lease to shield Luther and Mary from liability.
	•	Since Luther and Mary collected rent and handled the property personally, they remain directly liable, regardless of any retroactive registration.

(b) Amarlu Enterprises Violated Tax Laws
	•	Amarlu Enterprises received $36,000 in rental income during the lease term, but it:
	•	Was unregistered in Florida, meaning it could not legally transact business or collect revenue in the state.
	•	Likely failed to report and pay applicable Florida taxes (e.g., corporate income tax or use tax).
	•	Retroactive registration does not absolve past tax violations. Florida tax authorities can still investigate and penalize the entity for unreported income generated in the state, further bolstering your argument of bad-faith business practices.

(c) Statutory Violations and Bad Faith
	•	Retroactive registration does not erase:
	•	The failure to notify you within 30 days of where the security deposit was held (§83.49).
	•	The failure to disclose Amarlu Enterprises on the lease agreement.
	•	The unlawful retention or conversion of your property (§715.10–715.111).
	•	These violations occurred while Amarlu Enterprises was unregistered and remain actionable regardless of registration status.

(d) Fraudulent Conduct and Lack of Transparency
	•	Retroactive registration does not address the deceptive nature of Luther’s conduct in:
	•	Redirecting funds to Amarlu Enterprises without disclosure.
	•	Operating an unregistered entity in Florida for nearly the entire lease term.
	•	Failing to inform you of the legal structure of the entity collecting rent, which constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation.

5. Strategy for Your Case

To mitigate any potential impact of retroactive registration, you should:

(a) Address the Registration Issue in Your Letter
	•	Point out that Amarlu Enterprises was unregistered in Florida during the lease term, making its actions illegal under §605.0902.
	•	Highlight that retroactive registration, even if pursued, does not:
	•	Change the fact that Luther and Mary are personally named on the lease and remain directly liable.
	•	Erase tax violations or fraudulent conduct that occurred during the unregistered period.

(b) Emphasize Personal Liability
	•	Make clear that Luther and Mary personally signed the lease and are responsible for the violations, regardless of Amarlu Enterprises’ registration status.
	•	Focus on their personal failure to comply with §83.49 (security deposit handling) and other landlord-tenant obligations.

(c) Raise the Issue of Tax Violations
	•	Assert that Amarlu Enterprises likely failed to pay Florida taxes on the $36,000 in rent collected, which underscores the pattern of noncompliance and bad faith.
	•	If necessary, report this to the Florida Department of Revenue to strengthen your case and increase the pressure on Luther.

6. Why You’re in a Strong Position
	•	Retroactive registration does not absolve prior violations or shield Luther and Mary from personal liability.
	•	The lease explicitly names them as landlords, meaning their personal assets remain at risk, even if Amarlu Enterprises is later registered.
	•	The combination of unregistered activity, undisclosed tax obligations, and fraudulent conduct creates a strong case for damages against both Luther personally and Amarlu Enterprises.

Conclusion

While retroactive registration might allow Amarlu Enterprises to participate in legal proceedings, it does not shield Luther or Mary from personal liability for the lease or past violations. The court will focus on the fact that the lease names Luther and Mary personally, that Amarlu Enterprises was unregistered during the lease term, and that statutory obligations were not met. By addressing these points in your response, you can effectively neutralize any potential strategy involving retroactive registration.
