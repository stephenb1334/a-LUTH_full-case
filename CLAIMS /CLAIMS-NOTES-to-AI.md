1. Florida Statutes Obligations for Security Deposits When Landlord Owns Fewer Than Five Rental Units

Florida Statutes §83.49 governs security deposits, with specific distinctions for landlords based on the number of rental units they own. Here’s the breakdown relevant to your situation:

Landlord With Fewer Than Five Rental Units:

If the landlord (in this case, Luther Rollins) owns fewer than five rental units in Florida:
	•	The landlord does not have to place the security deposit in a separate account or issue a surety bond like larger landlords or property management companies must.
	•	However, written notice is still required within 30 days of receiving the deposit. The notice must include:
	•	The location of the security deposit.
	•	The type of account in which the deposit is held (if applicable).
	•	Whether interest is accruing.
If the landlord fails to provide this notice within 30 days, they forfeit the right to retain any portion of the deposit in the event of a dispute, even if damages occur.

Implications for an Out-of-State Landlord With One Property:
	•	Even if Luther Rollins owns only this single Florida rental property and resides out of state, he is still obligated to comply with §83.49’s notice requirements. The fact that the deposit was not placed in a Florida financial institution does not automatically violate the law because he owns fewer than five properties.
	•	However, failing to notify you of where and how the deposit was held within 30 days constitutes a statutory violation, regardless of the number of units he owns. This omission strengthens your case.

2. Florida Financial Institution Requirement for Landlords With Five or More Rental Units

If a landlord or entity owns five or more rental properties in Florida, they must:
	•	Hold the security deposit in a Florida-based financial institution—meaning:
	•	It must be in a bank account established and maintained in the state of Florida.
	•	This applies whether the bank is a national institution (e.g., Bank of America, PNC) or a regional Florida bank (e.g., Regions Bank, Fifth Third).
	•	Written notice within 30 days must still be provided, specifying:
	•	The name and address of the Florida financial institution where the deposit is held.
	•	Whether the account is interest-bearing or not.

If the landlord owns five or more rental units and fails to comply with these requirements, they are in violation of §83.49 and risk penalties, including forfeiture of the deposit and statutory damages.

3. Obligations of an Individual Landlord With Less Than Five Units (Like Luther Rollins)

For landlords like Luther Rollins, who owns fewer than five Florida rental units:
	•	Within 30 Days: He must provide written notice detailing:
	1.	The name and address of the institution where the deposit is held (even if it is out-of-state).
	2.	Whether the account is interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing.
	•	If the 30-Day Notice Is Not Provided:
	•	Per §83.49(2), the landlord forfeits any right to make a claim on the security deposit, regardless of damages or disputes.
	•	The entire deposit must be refunded if the tenant challenges the retention, and the landlord cannot retain funds even if damages occurred.

Since you did not receive notice within the required 30 days, this is a clear statutory violation. This strengthens your claim that the deposit must be refunded in full, irrespective of any alleged damages or disputes.

4. Discovery of Whether the Landlord Owns More Than Five Properties

The distinction between whether Luther Rollins or Amarlu Enterprises owns five or more Florida rental properties is critical because it changes how the security deposit must be handled. If you requested this information in your dispute letter and it was ignored:
	•	This could be seen as bad faith and a failure to act transparently under Florida law.
	•	Since Luther Rollins failed to clarify whether he owns more than five rental units, you can argue that the lack of transparency itself adds to the landlord’s statutory violations, particularly if Amarlu Enterprises is involved as a possible entity holding additional properties.

What Happens If the Landlord Owns More Than Five Properties?

If it is discovered that Luther Rollins or Amarlu Enterprises collectively owns more than five Florida rental properties:
	1.	The security deposit would need to be held in a Florida-based financial institution.
	2.	The landlord’s failure to do so, combined with the lack of notice, would be a violation of §83.49.
	3.	This strengthens claims for penalties, damages, and full recovery of the deposit.

5. Key Cross-References to Statutes to Bolster Your Claim
	•	§83.49(2): Requires notice of how the security deposit is held within 30 days of receipt. Failure to do so forfeits the landlord’s claim to the deposit.
	•	§83.49(3): The landlord bears the burden of proof in disputes over the security deposit. Failure to comply with notice requirements constitutes bad faith and can result in penalties, including treble damages.
	•	§83.49(1): Specifies requirements for managing security deposits based on the number of units owned.

6. Recommended Next Steps
	•	Strengthen Your Argument:
	•	Highlight that the landlord failed to provide notice of the security deposit within 30 days, as required by §83.49(2).
	•	Emphasize the absence of transparency regarding the number of units owned and their potential implications for security deposit management.
	•	Request Records During Discovery:
	•	Demand disclosure of how the security deposit was managed, including:
	•	Bank account records for the deposit.
	•	A list of all Florida rental properties owned by Luther Rollins and Amarlu Enterprises.
	•	If the landlord refuses to provide this information, this further supports claims of bad faith.
	•	Claim Refund of Entire Deposit:
	•	Given the failure to provide the statutory 30-day notice, the landlord has forfeited any right to retain the deposit, regardless of disputes over damages.

Conclusion

Luther Rollins’ failure to notify you of where and how the $4,500 deposit was held, combined with his lack of transparency about his property holdings, constitutes a clear violation of Florida Statutes §83.49. Regardless of whether he owns fewer than five rental units, he was required to provide written notice within 30 days, which he did not. This strengthens your case for a full refund of the deposit, statutory damages, and additional penalties for bad faith retention of funds. Additionally, if it is found that Amarlu Enterprises or Rollins owns more than five properties, the lack of compliance with Florida financial institution requirements further bolsters your claims.

**C. STATUTORY COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS: A LABYRINTH OF ILLEGALITY**

  

**NORTH CAROLINA REQUIREMENTS**

The misuse of addresses in North Carolina suggests multiple statutory violations:

• **Violation of “No P.O. Box” Mandate (N.C.G.S. § 66-71.4):** Designating a P.O. Box for official business registration contravenes state requirements prohibiting such listings.

• **False Physical Location Representation:** Providing a fictitious street address undermines the transparency mandated by North Carolina business registration laws.

• **Improper Business Address Registration:** Bypassing required protocols for address registration indicates an unauthorized approach to business operations.

• **Non-Compliance with State Statutes:** These actions demonstrate a disregard for North Carolina’s statutory framework governing legitimate business registration.

  

**FEDERAL POSTAL REGULATIONS**

Certain practices raise further concerns at the federal level:

• **Misuse of Federal Facility Address:** Employing a federal facility address for business-related activities can violate postal regulations.

• **Improper Commercial Address Representation:** Portraying a false physical location for commercial dealings runs counter to established federal guidelines.

• **Potential Mail Fraud Concerns:** Utilizing misrepresented addresses and a P.O. Box may open questions about fraudulent practices.

• **USPS Policy Violations:** Failing to adhere to USPS standards for address usage underscores additional procedural breaches.

  

**IV. FLORIDA PROPERTY OPERATIONS AND COMPLIANCE: A SECOND ARENA OF ISSUES**

  

While problems arise in North Carolina, Florida-based concerns also affect property ownership and leasing.

**A. NO DISCLOSURE OF ENTITY TYPE - LLC:**  

**A. NO NOTICE WITHIN 30 DAYS - SECURITY DEPOSIT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, NO RESPONSE TO NUMBER OF HELD RENTALS IN FLORIDA** 

**A. PROPERTY OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE:**



• **Property Type:** Residential, located in Florida.

• **Legal Owner:** Titled to “Luther J. Rollins, Jr.” in individual capacity.

• **Ownership Documentation:** The property is recorded under a personal name, yet the day-to-day rent collection references “Amarlu Enterprises.”

• **Absence of Formal Management Company:** No official property management entity is in place.

• **No Registered Business Entity:** No corporate or LLC structure for Florida operations.

• **Informal Payment Collection:** Instructions to mail rent to a North Carolina P.O. Box, bypassing standard channels.

• **Unauthorized Business Activities:** Collecting rent in Florida without registering as a foreign or domestic entity appears to contravene state rules.

  

**B. LEASE AGREEMENT ANALYSIS: A MASTERCLASS IN OMISSION**

The lease for the Florida property raises questions of omission and questionable terms:

• **Document Structure:** The landlord’s personal names appear, but no mention is made of the entity (Amarlu Enterprises) that receives the rent.

• **Parties to Agreement:** Listed as “Luther Rollins” and “Mary O. Polk,” plus two tenant signatories.

• **Business Entity Identification:** The lease does not acknowledge Amarlu Enterprises, despite its role in collecting payments.

• **Management Company Information:** No disclosed property manager, leaving communication channels ambiguous.

• **Legal Operating Authority:** The lease gives no statement showing any valid registration in Florida.

• **State-Required Disclosures:** Lacking or incomplete references to mandated disclosures.

• **Payment Instructions vs. Actual Practice:** While the lease references the landlords personally, tenants were verbally told to send checks to a North Carolina address.

• **Mismatch in Named Parties:** The discrepancy between named landlords in the lease and the actual rent recipient calls legal clarity into question.

• **Improper Payment Processing:** No recognized banking or escrow procedure in evidence, an arrangement that can conflict with standard Florida landlord-tenant guidelines.

  

This environment suggests purposeful obfuscation, with Amarlu Enterprises left out of formal lease documents yet acting as the de facto recipient of rent. The above issues point toward a larger pattern of noncompliance in both North Carolina and Florida, exposing tenants to uncertain legal protections and subjecting the landlords to significant statutory and regulatory challenges.

  

**SUMMARY OF FACTS: AMARLU ENTERPRISES, AMARLU COMPANY, & AMARLU CONSULTANTS**

A dispute involving these entities—on one side, representing the interests of two individual tenants, and on the other, the landlords (Luther J. Rollins & Mary O. Polk)—reveals critical failures to honor Florida statutes and recognized landlord-tenant standards. The landlords’ arrangement involves undisclosed foreign entities, potential misrepresentations, and possible tax infractions, all undermining the lease’s enforceability under Florida law.

  

Although the lease lists only Luther and Mary in their personal capacities, $36,000 OF THE $45,000 of monthly rent amounts were ultimately funneled by the written instructions from Luther, arrived via package to 2649 Tifton St. S. Gulfport, FL 33711 on Nov 29, 2023 (30 days into the lease. Also, no mention of how tenants would be paying months 2-9 as months 1 and 10 were included as first, last month's rent with security deposit and pet fee equalling $14,000 move-in costs and the only amounts paid to Luther Rollins as instructed by Zach Steinberger in the move-in process to make cashiers check for $14,000 to Luther Rollins which tenants did), and the rest of the $50,000 ($45,000 + $4,500 security deposit + $500 pet deposit) to Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina entity never disclosed in the lease nor registered in Florida, contravening the transparency obligations placed on landlords. Such omissions violate foreign entity registration requirements, diminishing legal clarity for tenants.

  

**Landlord’s Use of Mr. Zachary “Zach” Steinberger**

The presence of Mr. Steinberger, a realtor potentially motivated by continued business dealings with Luther, complicates the situation. His input may be compromised by personal interests rather than an unbiased professional assessment, rendering it questionable in evaluating damages or compliance questions.

  

**Potential Legal Violations**

The approach of omitting Amarlu Enterprises from the lease, directing tenants to an unregistered foreign entity, and any attempt to obscure compliance with tax or licensure requirements raises various legal issues—ranging from unregistered foreign business activity and possible fraud to statutory noncompliance.

  

**OBSERVED VIOLATIONS**

1. **Foreign Entity Registration Violation (Florida Statutes § 605.0902)**

• Amarlu Enterprises, as a North Carolina-based business entity, collected Florida rent without registering as a foreign LLC.

2. **Transparency and Disclosure Failures**

• Rent was directed to an unrecognized party, Amarlu Enterprises, without tenants’ explicit knowledge or consent in the lease.

3. **Tax and Regulatory Concerns**

• The unregistered entity collecting rent raises questions about accurate state and federal tax compliance.

4. **Potential Fraud**

• Deliberate omission of Amarlu Enterprises in official documentation may demonstrate fraudulent intent to hide its involvement.

5. **Conflict of Interest**

• Realtor Zachary “Zach” Steinberger’s role as a prospective business partner may cast doubt on his impartiality in damage or lease matters.

  

**LANDLORD’S LEGAL VIOLATIONS**

1. **Failure to Register a Foreign Entity**

• Amarlu Enterprises is not registered in Florida despite conducting commercial business by collecting rental payments.

2. **Non-Disclosure of Amarlu Enterprises**

• The lease omits any mention of the entity receiving all funds, compromising transparency.

3. **Consequences of Non-Compliance**

• Unregistered entities commonly lose standing in Florida courts, making it problematic for them to assert claims in lease disputes.

  

**TENANT’S POSITION ON UNENFORCEABILITY OF THE LEASE**

  

The tenant argues that the lease cannot be enforced because:

• All rental payments were funneled through a non-disclosed and unregistered entity, violating Florida’s rules for foreign entities.

• Any claim for damages is overshadowed by these statutory breaches, likely nullifying the landlord’s attempts to enforce provisions related to the security deposit or alleged damages.

  

**Good Faith and Offset**

The tenant fulfilled rental obligations in good faith. Should any property damages exist, they would be nominal and must be offset against any statutory violations, deposit withholdings, or other improper actions by the landlord.

  

**LANDLORD’S CLAIM FOR ENTIRE $4,500 SECURITY DEPOSIT**

  

Under Fla. Stat. § 83.49, landlords must give precise, itemized notices with verifiable documentation. General allegations—excessive trash, spoiled food, unauthorized alterations, or unverified claims about missing furnishings—lack legal sufficiency if not supported by comprehensive before-and-after evidence.

  

**Connection to Unregistered Entity**

Because the landlord used a non-disclosed, unregistered foreign entity to handle funds, a court may find the entire arrangement defective. There is limited or no standing to enforce the lease’s clauses or to claim the security deposit in full, particularly absent compliant documentation.

  

**Lack of Evidence**

Minor incidents, such as minor cleaning or normal turnover items (spoiled food, minor scuffs), do not justify a total forfeiture of the deposit. Larger claims, like missing or damaged property, require signed inventory lists or detailed photos establishing the pre-tenancy condition.

  

**Legal Taint**

Since the landlord disregarded Florida’s foreign entity regulations, the legitimacy of any claim for damages or withheld security deposit is further compromised.

  

This neutral version omits any language that could be perceived as pressuring, threatening, or extortive. It focuses solely on factual statements, legal requirements, and the potential implications under relevant statutes.


### **Failure to Maintain a Habitable Property**

Under **Fla. Stat. §83.51(1)**, landlords are required to ensure properties meet all building, housing, and health codes. Key incidents during my tenancy include:

-   **January 2024:** A severely clogged kitchen sink rendered the property unsanitary for 15 days. You failed to arrange repairs, forcing me to handle the issue independently.
    
-   **March 2024:** Faulty motion lights and deteriorated gates facilitated a violent home invasion. Despite acknowledging these safety concerns, you took no action to address them.
    
-   **April 2024:** Overhanging tree limbs above outdoor electrical cables created hazardous conditions. Neglected vegetation, including bamboo, an alleged jackfruit tree, and other trees, added to safety risks.





### **January 2024: Failure to Address Critical Maintenance (Clogged Kitchen Sink)**

**Incident:**  
In **January 2024**, I reported a **severely clogged kitchen sink** that rendered one side of the sink unusable. Water stagnated for **15 consecutive days**, creating unsanitary and potentially hazardous living conditions. Despite my clear communications outlining the issue and requesting timely resolution, you failed to respond or take action to address the problem. Ultimately, after over two weeks of inaction, I was left with no choice but to resolve the issue independently at my own expense.

* * *

**Impact and Precedent Set:**  
Your complete lack of response and failure to fulfill your legal obligation to maintain the property set a **clear precedent** for how all future maintenance, sanitary, and safety concerns would be handled—or, rather, neglected—by you as the landlord. As a tenant living in **Florida** while you remained out of state in **North Carolina**, your geographic absence, combined with delays in communication (or outright silence), indicated to me that **immediate and urgent concerns** requiring action would have to be resolved **entirely by me** in order to ensure my basic health, safety, and habitability.

This incident signaled a lack of support and responsiveness, forcing me to accept that any similar emergencies—whether sanitary hazards, maintenance failures, or security breaches—would likely be **ignored** or delayed to the point where I would be required to handle them myself, regardless of cost, burden, or legal obligation.

* * *

**Statutory Basis:**

*   **Fla. Stat. § 83.51(2)(a):**  
    "The landlord shall make reasonable provisions for \[...\] running water and hot water."
*   **Fla. Stat. § 83.51(1)(b):**  
    "The landlord shall maintain the plumbing in reasonable working condition."

* * *

**Violation:**  
You violated your statutory duty to maintain essential plumbing facilities in functional condition, leaving me without a sanitary kitchen sink for over **15 days**. This failure was not an isolated lapse but an early indication that tenant needs—no matter how urgent—would be neglected unless handled directly by me.

* * *

**Supporting Evidence:**

*   Text messages documenting my notification of the clogged sink and your lack of response.
*   Follow-up text confirming I completed the repair independently due to your inaction.

* * *

**Conclusion:**  
The January 2024 sink incident exposed the **systemic inadequacy** of your responsiveness as an out-of-state landlord and set a troubling expectation: that any immediate or urgent safety, sanitary, or maintenance issue would be my responsibility, despite Florida law clearly placing this burden on the landlord. The failure to take corrective action, combined with the geographic disconnect, left me to live under the assumption that your neglect was a **requirement of living in your property**, as further evidenced by subsequent failures to address far more serious safety and habitability concerns later in the tenancy.

This incident laid the foundation for the recurring pattern of neglect and delayed communication that would continue to compromise my well-being and safety throughout the lease term.

**Tenant’s Prompt Communication:**  
I promptly reported the issue to you, clearly describing the problem and requesting guidance or repairs. Despite this, you failed to respond or arrange for any professional intervention to address the issue. Instead, I was left without a functioning sink for over two weeks.

**Tenant’s Self-Resolution:**  
After receiving no assistance or acknowledgment of my requests, I was forced to resolve the issue independently by purchasing tools and de-clogging solutions to clear the blockage. Following the repair, I documented my actions and informed you of the resolution via text message. However, there was no response or offer of reimbursement for my time and expenses.

**Pattern of Neglect:**  
This incident set a precedent for how maintenance and safety concerns would be handled during my tenancy. Your delayed responses—or complete lack thereof—indicated that immediate or urgent matters, regardless of their impact on health or habitability, would not receive the necessary support or attention from you. As a result, I was forced to anticipate and address such issues on my own to maintain a basic standard of living in the property.

**Violation of Florida Law:**  
Under **Fla. Stat. §83.51(2)(a)**, you are required to maintain essential facilities, such as plumbing, in working order. By neglecting to respond to a critical issue like this, you violated your statutory obligation to ensure that the property remained habitable and in compliance with health standards. This neglect further demonstrated a disregard for your duty as a landlord to support the tenant’s basic living needs and provide a safe and functional living environment.



### **March 2024: Home Invasion Enabled by Faulty Motion Lights and Deteriorating Gates**

**Incident:**  
On **March 26, 2024**, a **violent home invasion** occurred at approximately 3:00 A.M., facilitated by **deteriorating wooden gates** that could not lock, latch, or close properly, along with **faulty outdoor motion lights** that failed to activate and provide an alert. This terrifying incident required police intervention, culminating in the arrest of the intruder—a man with a documented history of **40 prior arrests, including 9 felonies**.

I immediately notified you of the break-in, provided photographic and police report evidence, and explicitly detailed the critical safety deficiencies that allowed the event to occur. Specifically, I requested:

-   **Repairs or replacement of the wooden side gates** with secure, metal locking gates.
-   **Repairs to faulty motion lights**, which failed to function reliably.

While you verbally acknowledged the deteriorating state of the gates and their need for replacement, you took no action to address these safety failures. Instead, you merely authorized me to install security cameras **at my own expense** under the condition that no drilling into the property would occur. This response was wholly inadequate and failed to meet the safety requirements demanded by law.

***

**Statutory Basis:**

-   **Fla. Stat. § 83.51(1)(a):**  
    "The landlord at all times during the tenancy shall:  
    (a) Comply with the requirements of applicable building, housing, and health codes."
-   **Fla. Stat. § 83.51(2)(a):**  
    "The landlord shall make reasonable provisions for locks and keys."

***

**Violation:**  
Your refusal to address critical safety hazards—gates incapable of locking and faulty motion lights—violated your statutory duty to provide a secure, habitable property. The failure to act after a documented **life-threatening incident**constitutes a reckless disregard for tenant safety.

***f

**Impact on Tenant:**

-   **Physical and Psychological Trauma**: The break-in caused immense fear, exacerbating my **documented PTSD**and leaving me and my family feeling unsafe in the home.
-   **Financial Burden**: I was forced to invest in self-funded security measures (e.g., cameras) to compensate for your neglect of basic safety obligations.
-   **Continued Fear and Anxiety**: Knowing the intruder was familiar with the property and its vulnerabilities heightened my distress. Your failure to act perpetuated an environment of ongoing insecurity.

***

**Supporting Evidence:**

-   Text messages notifying you of the break-in and requesting security improvements.
-   Photos and videos documenting the deteriorating gates and faulty motion lights.
-   Police report detailing the incident and arrest of the intruder.
-   Communications in which you acknowledged the unsafe condition of the gates and motion lights but failed to implement repairs.

***

**Conclusion:**  
The violent home invasion and your subsequent refusal to address safety concerns represent gross negligence and a violation of **Fla. Stat. § 83.51**. You acknowledged the property’s vulnerabilities but deliberately chose to place the financial burden for security improvements on me, the tenant. Your inaction exacerbated the trauma caused by the incident and directly contributed to my emotional distress and financial loss. This incident, coupled with your prior failure to address maintenance concerns, demonstrates a **pattern of willful neglect** and disregard for your legal duties under Florida law.




### **April 2024: Landlord’s On-Site Visit and Continued Neglect of Safety Issues**

During an **April 2024** onsite visit to the property, you, the landlord, physically observed critical safety concerns yet took no action to address them. These included:

-   **Sagging Tree Limbs:** Overhanging branches posed a hazard by hanging dangerously close to outdoor electrical cables above the primary outdoor area.
    
-   **Deteriorated Side Gate Entrance:** The side gate, with no working latch or locks and visibly deteriorating wood, presented a clear security risk. You acknowledged the gate’s condition but did not take steps to repair or secure it.
    
-   **Faulty Motion Lights:** I showed you the non-functional motion lights during your visit, highlighting their failure to provide consistent or reliable illumination. These lights, critical for detecting motion and ensuring safety after the March 2024 home invasion, contributed more to distress with their erratic flickering than to security.
    

**Follow-Up Documentation:**  
Following your visit, I reintroduced the issue of the faulty motion lights via text message and provided a video recording to demonstrate their erratic behavior. Despite this, you failed to respond or take action, ignoring requests to revisit these critical safety concerns and explore your previous mention of installing metal gates to enhance property security.

**Pattern of Neglect:**  
Your failure to address these longstanding safety hazards—despite being physically present on-site, personally observing the issues, and receiving follow-up documentation—exemplifies an ongoing pattern of disregard for tenant safety. This inaction came just weeks after the March 2024 home invasion, further compounding the tenant’s distress and insecurity. Your unwillingness to act directly contravenes your statutory obligations under **Fla. Stat. §83.51**, which require landlords to maintain structural components in good repair and ensure the safety of the property.

### MISREPRESENTATION AND LEGAL STATUS


The landlords, Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk, engaged in a systematic misrepresentation of their legal status and business operations, a calculated deception intended to obscure their true intentions and evade regulatory scrutiny. By failing to disclose the existence and role of Amarlu Enterprises in the lease agreement, they created a false impression of who the tenants were contracting with. This omission was not merely an oversight; it was a deliberate act of concealment, aimed at misleading the tenants and depriving them of essential information about the true parties involved in the transaction. 

Furthermore, by directing payments to Amarlu Enterprises, an unregistered entity in Florida, they created a complex and opaque financial structure that violated Florida's foreign entity registration laws (§ 605.0902). This deliberate obfuscation of their legal status and business operations is not only a breach of contract but also a clear indication of bad faith and a potential attempt to evade tax obligations. The use of a P.O. Box address, coupled with the misrepresentation of a physical business location, further compounds this deception, creating a false sense of legitimacy while actively violating both state and federal regulations. This pattern of misrepresentation is not a minor infraction; it's a fundamental flaw that undermines the entire foundation of their business dealings and exposes them to significant legal and financial liabilities.


### SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: IMPROPER NOTICE

The landlords' handling of the security deposit is a textbook example of how NOT to comply with Florida law, a symphony of violations that demonstrates a blatant disregard for tenant rights. The initial "Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit" was a masterclass in noncompliance, failing to provide the itemization mandated by Florida Statute §83.49(3). This is not a minor oversight; it's a fundamental breach of their legal obligations. The notice lacked sufficient detail and specificity, preventing the tenant from making an informed objection. The use of an incorrect zip code further compounded this violation, creating a delay in the tenant's receipt of the notice and impeding their ability to respond within the statutory timeframe. This is not a simple clerical error; it's a calculated move to obstruct the tenant's right to due process. Furthermore, the landlords failed to disclose the location and status of the security deposit, a clear violation of Florida law. 

This lack of transparency is not only a breach of their legal obligations but also a clear indication of their intent to conceal their actions. Finally, the landlords' unlawful deductions from the security deposit, without proper documentation or justification, and their subsequent failure to provide evidence in subsequent letters, further solidifies their pattern of noncompliance and bad faith. This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to unlawfully retain funds that rightfully belong to the tenant.



### SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: INCORRECT ADDRESS

The landlords' use of an incorrect zip code on the notice of intent to impose a claim on the security deposit is not a simple clerical error; it's a calculated act of obstruction designed to impede the tenant's ability to respond within the statutory timeframe. By using the incorrect zip code, the landlords created a delay in the delivery of the notice, effectively shortening the 15-day window the tenant had to object to the claim. This is not a minor mistake; it's a deliberate attempt to manipulate the legal process and undermine the tenant's right to due process. The fact that the landlords used a P.O. Box address, which is not a valid business address, further compounds this violation, creating a situation where the tenant was forced to visit a post office to retrieve the notice, adding an additional layer of inconvenience and delay. This manipulation of the mailing address is not just a procedural error; it's a deliberate attempt to obstruct the tenant's ability to respond to the claim and to unlawfully retain the security deposit.

   - This record establishes a pattern of progressive address misrepresentation
   - This continues to demonstrate systematic attempts to obscure legitimate business locations and contact information, which is in violation of applicable federal regulations.



### SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: FAILURE TO DISCLOSE

TThe landlords' failure to provide proper notice regarding the security deposit is a clear violation of Florida Statute §83.49(3)(a), a cornerstone of tenant protection. The law mandates that landlords must provide a written notice by certified mail within 30 days of the tenant vacating, stating their intent to impose a claim on the security deposit and the reasons for it. This notice must be specific and detailed, allowing the tenant to understand the basis for the claim and to formulate an informed response. 

The landlords' notice failed on multiple fronts: it lacked sufficient detail and itemization of damages, preventing the tenant from understanding the specific charges and making a meaningful objection. Despite the tenant's request for clarification, the landlord merely implied in the first letter that he had the necessary evidence to support his claims. 

If he indeed possessed such evidence, it stands to reason that it would have been presented in the second letter, especially given his expressed desire to avoid litigation. Instead, by withholding this alleged evidence for a second time, the landlord appears to be encouraging a dispute rather than resolving it. 

The vague references to "excessive garbage," "spoiled food," and "damage to the walls," without any supporting evidence or specific locations, are insufficient to meet the legal requirements. This lack of specificity is not a minor oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to circumvent the law and deny the tenant their right to due process. The landlords' failure to provide a proper notice is not just a procedural error; it's a fundamental breach of their legal obligations that renders their claim on the security deposit invalid.

The landlords' failure to provide a proper notice is not just a procedural error; it's a fundamental breach of their legal obligations that renders their claim on the security deposit invalid.

### SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: UNLAWFUL DEDUCTIONS

The landlords' unlawful deductions from the security deposit, without proper documentation or justification, are a blatant violation of Florida Statute §83.49(3). 

The law requires landlords to provide an itemized list of damages and supporting evidence when withholding any portion of the security deposit. 

The landlords' vague references to "excessive garbage," "spoiled food," and "damage to the walls" without any specific details, photos, or receipts, are not sufficient to meet the legal requirements. 

This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to unlawfully retain funds that rightfully belong to the tenant. T

he landlords' failure to provide a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with each deduction, along with supporting documentation, is a clear indication of their intent to circumvent the law and to unlawfully enrich themselves at the tenant's expense. This is not a minor infraction; it's a fundamental breach of their legal obligations that renders their claim on the security deposit invalid.


### SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: WITHHOLDING WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION

The landlord retained the full security deposit of $4,500 without providing adequate justification or evidence of damage. Initially, the landlord’s assertion regarding the security deposit lacked clarity and failed to present the necessary specific details or itemized claims. This absence of specificity contravenes Florida law, which delineates clear requirements for the management of security deposits.

The notice issued by the landlord cited multiple damage claims or issues concerning the property. However, these allegations were not supported by any concrete evidence, placing the tenant in a challenging position. Furthermore, when the landlord subsequently offered to return $1,500 of the security deposit, he failed to explain why the remaining $3,000 continued to be withheld. This behavior further illustrates his lack of justification for retaining such a substantial portion of the deposit.

The landlord’s actions demonstrate a clear disregard for the legal standards established in Florida regarding the management and return of security deposits. The tenant contends that it is inappropriate for the landlord to justify deductions from the security deposit based on potential future maintenance costs or damages. Additionally, courts have consistently ruled that vague notices, which do not provide explicit justification, are insufficient to legally withhold any portion of the deposit..

### SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE IN SUBSEQUENT LETTERS

The landlords' failure to provide any supporting evidence in subsequent letters, despite the tenant's formal dispute and request for documentation, further solidifies their pattern of noncompliance and bad faith. The law requires landlords to provide timely, itemized evidence to justify any deductions from the security deposit. The landlords' continued reliance on vague allegations and unsubstantiated claims, without providing any photos, receipts, or other supporting documentation, is a clear indication of their inability to meet the legal requirements. This is not a case of simple oversight; it's a deliberate attempt to avoid accountability and to unlawfully retain the tenant's funds. The landlords' failure to provide evidence in subsequent letters is not just a procedural error; it's a deliberate attempt to undermine the tenant's right to due process and to unlawfully retain the security deposit.

This detailed analysis, far exceeding the original document's length, provides a comprehensive overview of the landlords' violations. We have meticulously documented every misstep, every act of deception, and every breach of their legal obligations. This is not just a case of simple noncompliance; it's a pattern of calculated misconduct that demands a strong and decisive response. We will use this information to build a case that will hold the landlords accountable for their actions and secure maximum legal and financial recourse for the tenant.

### UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: FAILURE TO PROVIDE NOTICE

The landlord violated Florida Statute §715.104 by failing to provide written notice to the tenant regarding personal property left behind after the lease ended. This statute mandates that landlords must inform former tenants about any personal property that remains on the premises. It requires them to describe the items left behind and specify a clear timeframe for retrieval. In this case, the landlord not only neglected to deliver this legally required notice, but also failed to provide an itemized list of the personal property. Specifically, the tenant had left behind a Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill along with several other belongings.

Additionally, the landlord did not respond to multiple written requests made by the tenant, dated September 25, 2024, and September 27, 2024, which asked for the retrieval of the personal property. This lack of response further illustrates the landlord's failure to comply with the statute. The absence of written notice and the inability to address the tenant's requests indicate a significant violation of their responsibilities under Florida law. The landlord's actions reflect a serious disregard for the legally mandated procedures concerning the handling of a tenant's abandoned personal property.

The failure to provide the required notice as stipulated by §715.104 is not merely a minor oversight; it represents a direct violation of Florida law. Such negligence places the landlord at odds with established statutory procedures. By failing to notify the tenant, the landlord deprived them of the opportunity to reclaim their possessions, including the Weber grill and other personal items. Florida law explicitly requires landlords to deliver written notifications to former tenants, detailing the existence of any personal property left behind and affording them a chance to retrieve those items before any disposal actions occur. The landlord's inaction in this matter is a clear failure to uphold his legal responsibilities, highlighting a significant lapse in following the proper protocols for handling a tenant's abandoned personal property.

### UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: CONVERSION OF PROPERTY

The landlords' actions go beyond mere retention; they constitute a clear case of conversion, the unauthorized use and control of another's property inconsistent with their ownership rights. By failing to allow the tenant to retrieve their personal property, and then using the tenant's Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill to market the rental property, the landlords exercised dominion over the tenant's belongings in a manner that is inconsistent with the tenant's ownership rights. This is not a case of simple possession; it's a deliberate act of conversion, a violation of the tenant's property rights. The use of the tenant's grill as a marketing amenity is a particularly egregious example of this conversion, demonstrating a blatant disregard for the tenant's ownership and a clear intent to benefit from the tenant's property without their consent. This is not a minor infraction; it's a deliberate act of conversion that exposes the landlords to significant legal and financial liabilities.

The landlord's decisions reflect poor judgment and present a clear case of conversion regarding the tenant's personal property. In this context, conversion refers to the unauthorized control over someone’s belongings, which undermines their ownership rights. This situation is particularly evident in the landlord's choice to keep the tenant's Weber Spirit E-310 Propane Grill along with several other personal items. What exacerbates the seriousness of this case is that the landlord not only retained these possessions but also used them in a way that indicates a lack of respect for the tenant’s ownership.

Under Florida law, the intent to convert property is not a necessary element; rather, what is important is the act of controlling the property in a way that is inconsistent with the rights of the owner. The landlord’s actions in utilizing the grill and other personal items for advertising purposes clearly indicate an unauthorized use of the tenant’s property, thereby constituting conversion. This behavior reflects a blatant disregard for the tenant's rights.

Moreover, the landlord’s offer of $500 for the personal property further suggests an awareness of potential legal liability for his actions. In the case of Goodwin v. Alexatos, it was established that the unauthorized retention and use of someone else's property indeed amounts to conversion. This ruling allows the original owner to recover the value of their property, and they may also be entitled to punitive damages depending on the circumstances.

Additionally, the landlord’s actions violate Florida Statute §83.67(5), which explicitly prohibits landlords from using a tenant’s property without their consent. This legal framework is designed to protect tenants from such unauthorized actions, reinforcing the importance of respecting ownership rights and personal property.

### Unlawful Retention & Conversion of Personal Property: Shifting Burden of Proof

The landlord has attempted to shift the burden of proof onto the tenant by requesting evidence that the tenant's personal property was left on the premises73542. This is contrary to Florida law, which places the burden on the landlord to prove that the property was not present or that it had been abandoned73542. The landlord's actions imply that it was the tenant's responsibility to prove the existence of the personal property in the premises, but in reality, the burden of proof lies on the landlord to demonstrate that they have complied with Florida Statute §715.104 and to justify the claim that the property was not left at the property by the tenant73542. The landlord's attempt to shift the burden of proof is a misrepresentation of legal requirements.

The landlord is trying to evade his statutory obligations under Florida law by attempting to shift the burden of proof, which further demonstrates a pattern of bad faith73542. The landlord's approach not only contradicts established legal principles but also serves to obscure his own failures to comply with statutory requirements. By attempting to shift the burden of proof, the landlord is attempting to skirt his legal responsibility to properly notify the tenant regarding the disposition of their personal property and instead try to place this responsibility on the tenant73542. The landlord, rather than proving he had followed the law, was requiring the tenant to prove a negative, that he had not abandoned their personal property. The burden of proof lies with the landlord, and this shift is an attempt to avoid legal accountability73542.

### UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: SHIFTING BURDEN OF PROOF

The landlord misrepresented a text message from the tenant, creating a false implication that the tenant had abandoned their personal property. By selectively quoting only a portion of the text message, the landlord sought to establish a misleading narrative that suggested the tenant had forfeited any claim to their belongings. 

However, the complete text of the tenant's message clearly expresses an intention to recover the remaining possessions, rather than abandon them. The tenant indicated that they were "leaving town tonight indefinitely," but also stated, "It’s the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property. I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank you." This statement unequivocally demonstrates their intent to reclaim their belongings. The landlord’s selective quoting constitutes a deliberate effort to distort the facts and evade legal obligations under Florida law.

By omitting crucial parts of the tenant's message, the landlord engaged in misrepresentation of facts and attempted to evade his responsibilities in accordance with the law. This mischaracterization of communication further underscores the landlord's bad faith and intent to manipulate the situation to align with his own narrative while circumventing legal accountability. The landlord’s actions are not only a deliberate attempt to evade obligations but also illustrate a clear effort to distort communication. The complete context of the message reveals unequivocally that the tenant did not intend to abandon their property, but instead sought to responsibly manage their possessions despite leaving town temporarily.

### UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: MISREPRESENTATION OF ABANDONMENT

  
The landlord engaged in a deliberate misrepresentation of the tenant's intentions concerning their personal property, attempting to falsely portray the tenant as having abandoned their belongings, in direct contradiction of both the facts and Florida law. This misrepresentation revolves around a text message sent by the tenant on September 4, 2024, in which the tenant stated, "Hi Luther, I'm leaving town tonight indefinitely. It's the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property. I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank you." The landlord selectively quoted the initial part of this message, "I'm leaving town tonight indefinitely," while omitting the subsequent clarifying sentences that explicitly indicate the tenant’s intent to retrieve their property, not abandon it. By truncating the message, the landlord constructed a false narrative suggesting that the tenant had relinquished any claim to their belongings.

This selective quotation and misrepresentation represent a clear attempt by the landlord to avoid his legal obligations under Florida Statute §715.104234. This statute outlines the procedures a landlord must follow when a tenant leaves personal property behind, requiring written notice to the former tenant that describes the property and allows a reasonable opportunity for retrieval before disposing of the items. By misrepresenting the tenant as having abandoned their property, the landlord attempted to circumvent these statutory requirements.

The full context of the tenant's message, which the landlord deliberately ignored, clearly shows the tenant's intent to retrieve their remaining possessions. The tenant's statement, "It's the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property," indicates that the tenant understood their belongings remained at the property and was seeking the chance to collect the "other belongings" from the landlord. This message communicates that the tenant did not intend to abandon the property but, rather, was expressing their intention to retrieve it. The tenant's message clearly articulated their desire to reclaim their possessions, not to abandon them. The landlord's manipulation of this message is not a mere misunderstanding; it represents a deliberate effort to distort the facts and create a false premise to justify their actions concerning the tenant's personal property.

The landlord's misrepresentation of the tenant's text message is further exacerbated by their blatant failure to respond to the tenant's numerous requests for retrieving their personal property. On multiple occasions, specifically on September 25, 2024, and September 27, 2024, the tenant submitted written requests requesting access to the property to collect their belongings. Unfortunately, these requests were ignored by the landlord, who demonstrated a clear pattern of negligence and disregard for the tenant's rights. This behavior indicates a troubling intent on the part of the landlord to unlawfully withhold and convert the tenant's property for their own use.

The deliberate misrepresentation of the tenant's messages, coupled with the landlord's consistent neglect of their attempts to reclaim their belongings, illustrates a significant pattern of bad faith. This conduct not only undermines the tenant's rights but also stands in direct violation of Florida law, which is specifically designed to safeguard tenants from arbitrary and capricious actions taken by landlords. Such behavior significantly strengthens the tenant's case for aggravated damages, as the landlord’s misrepresentation of their intentions regarding property retrieval can be seen as a calculated attempt to justify their actions.

Moreover, the landlord’s misrepresentation served to rationalize the subsequent conversion of the tenant’s property, such as the unauthorized use of the tenant's Weber grill in the rental listing for marketing purposes. This blatant act demonstrates an effort by the landlord to evade legal responsibilities through misleading tactics and deception.

In conclusion, the landlord's misrepresentation of the tenant's text message is not merely an oversight but a deliberate strategy to shirk their legal obligations while unlawfully retaining and converting the tenant's property. This, along with their failure to provide the necessary legal notice and repeated refusal to acknowledge the tenant's retrieval requests, strongly illustrates a clear violation of Florida law and reflects a long-standing pattern of bad faith in dealing with tenants. The overall actions of the landlord showcase a disregard for the law and the rights of tenants, warranting significant concern and legal recourse for the affected individual.

### LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PREMISES

The landlord failed to maintain the premises in a safe and habitable condition, as required by Florida law. The landlord’s negligence is evident in several critical areas. For instance, the landlord did not address a severely clogged kitchen sink early in the tenancy, which forced the tenant to resolve the issue themselves, incurring expenses that should have covered by the landlord. This early neglect set a worrying precedent for the entire tenancy.

Furthermore, the landlord failed to address the repairs needed for a broken fence gate, despite receiving numerous notifications and engaging in discussions with the tenant regarding the urgency of the situation. This negligence resulted in a break-in, underscoring the landlord's lack of consideration for tenant safety. Additionally, the landlord's insufficient response to the safety concerns raised after the break-in—including the failure to improve property security—further highlights a troubling pattern of negligence.

The tenant also experienced difficulties in affixing security cameras to the physical structures on the property, which the landlord had previously agreed would be taken care of. These failures to address fundamental maintenance and security issues represent a clear breach of the implied warranty of habitability.

The landlord’s failure to maintain a safe and habitable property, mandated under Florida law, represents a severe breach of his responsibilities. The neglect surrounding maintenance issues, such as the clogged sink and broken fence, contributed directly to a compromised living environment. Moreover, the landlord's failure to respond adequately to security concerns following the break-in further illustrates a lack of concern for the tenant's safety and overall well-being.

These actions not only violate legal requirements but also significantly contributed to the tenant’s emotional distress, worsening pre-existing conditions. The landlord’s inaction represents a violation of the duty to maintain a safe and habitable property. This ongoing neglect compelled the tenant to take proactive measures regarding basic maintenance issues while living in an unsafe environment.

### LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO ADDRESS SECURITY CONCERNS

The landlord exhibited clear and actionable negligence by neglecting to address severe security concerns within the rental property, especially following a break-in on March 26, 2024. This negligence represents a direct violation of the landlord's legal obligation to uphold a safe and habitable environment for the tenant, as mandated by Florida law. Rather than being a mere oversight, this lack of action constitutes a pattern of negligent omissions that not only endangered the tenant but also exacerbated their existing vulnerabilities.

More specifically, the landlord was aware of the compromised condition of the fence gates, which were reported to be either not latching securely or not latching at all. These gates served as the entry point for the intruder during the break-in, clearly underscoring the immediate and significant security risk they posed. 

Despite this awareness and the tenant's direct requests to enhance the gates, the landlord failed to take necessary and appropriate actions. The tenant had even proposed the installation of metal gates equipped with functional locking mechanisms, yet the landlord disregarded these crucial suggestions. This inaction on the landlord's part not only heightened the tenant's vulnerability but also instilled a continual sense of insecurity regarding their safety. The landlord's inattention to secure the gates is a blatant breach of their duty of care to ensure the property is maintained in a safe condition.

Further compounding the issue, the landlord restricted the tenant's ability to install security cameras on the property. The landlord expressly prohibited the installation of cameras that could be fixed to the home's exterior or any structure on the property. 

This restriction effectively stifled the tenant's efforts to implement meaningful security measures, despite the evident need for such precautions in the wake of the break-in, especially considering that surrounding neighbors had taken the initiative to install security cameras. 

The landlord's refusal to permit the tenant to install adequate security cameras further exemplifies a blatant disregard for the tenant's safety, exacerbating the already substantial breach of their duty of care. Moreover, the landlord's indifference to addressing these pressing security issues has significantly contributed to the tenant's experience of post-traumatic stress disorder following the incident.

The landlord's negligence in addressing the security concerns extends beyond mere inconvenience; it constitutes a profound breach of their fundamental responsibility to guarantee a safe living environment for the tenant. 

The combination of unsecured gates and the prohibition against installing security cameras left the tenant vulnerable to further harm and directly resulted in emotional and psychological distress. This failure to adequately address security concerns represents a significant legal violation under Florida law, further underscoring the necessity for the landlord to uphold their obligations and responsibilities to their tenants.
