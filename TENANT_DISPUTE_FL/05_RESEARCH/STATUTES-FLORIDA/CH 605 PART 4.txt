Once a member deposits that member’s certificates or, in the case of uncertificated membership interests, returns the signed form described in s. 605.1065(2), the member loses all rights as a member, unless the member withdraws pursuant to subsection (2). Upon receiving a demand for payment from a member who holds an uncertificated membership interest, the limited liability company shall make an appropriate notation of the demand for payment in its records and shall restrict the transfer of the membership interest, or the applicable class or series, from the date the member delivers the items required by this section.
(2) A member who has complied with subsection (1) may nevertheless decline to exercise appraisal rights and withdraw from the appraisal process by so notifying the limited liability company in writing by the date provided in the appraisal notice pursuant to s. 605.1065(2)(b)7.

(3) A member who does not sign and return the form and, in the case of certificated membership interests, deposit that member’s certificates, if so required by the limited liability company, each by the date set forth in the notice described in s. 605.1065(2)(a), is not entitled to payment under ss. 605.1006 and 605.1061-605.1072.
(4) If the member’s right to receive fair value is terminated other than by the purchase of the membership interest by the limited liability company, all rights of the member, with respect to such membership interest, shall be reinstated effective as of the date the member delivered the items required by subsection (1), including the right to receive any intervening payment or other distribution with respect to such membership interest, or, if any such rights have expired or any such distribution other than a cash payment has been completed, in lieu thereof at the election of the limited liability company, the fair value thereof in cash as determined by the limited liability company as of the time of such expiration or completion, but without prejudice otherwise to any action or proceeding of the limited liability company that may have been taken by the limited liability company on or after the date the member delivered the items required by subsection (1).
History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180.

(1) If the member states on the form provided in s. 605.1065(1) that the member accepts the offer of the limited liability company to pay the limited liability company’s estimated fair value for the membership interest, the limited liability company shall make the payment to the member within 90 days after the limited liability company’s receipt of the items required by s. 605.1066(1).

(2) A member who fails to notify the limited liability company in writing of the member’s demand to be paid the member’s estimate of the fair value plus interest under subsection (1) within the timeframe provided in s. 605.1065(2)(b)2. waives the right to demand payment under this section and is entitled only to the payment offered by the limited liability company pursuant to s. 605.1065(2)(b)4.
History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180.
605.1069 Court action.—
(1) If a member makes demand for payment under s. 605.1068 which remains unsettled, the limited liability company shall commence a proceeding within 60 days after receiving the payment demand and petition the court to determine the fair value of the membership interest plus accrued interest from the date of the appraisal event. If the limited liability company does not commence the proceeding within the 60-day period, any member who has made a demand pursuant to s. 605.1068 may commence the proceeding in the name of the limited liability company.
(2) The proceeding must be commenced in the appropriate court of the county in which the limited liability company’s principal office in this state is located or, if none, the county in which its registered agent is located. If by virtue of the appraisal event becoming effective the entity has become a foreign entity without a registered agent in this state, the proceeding must be commenced in the county in this state in which the principal office or registered agent of the limited liability company was located immediately before the time the appraisal event became effective; if it has, and immediately before the appraisal event became effective had no principal office in this state, then in the county in which the limited liability company has, or immediately before the time the appraisal event became effective had, an office in this state; or if none in this state, then in the county in which the limited liability company’s registered office is or was last located.
(3) All members, whether or not residents of this state, whose demands remain unsettled shall be made parties to the proceeding as in an action against their membership interests. The limited liability company shall serve a copy of the initial pleading in such proceeding upon each member-party who is a resident of this state in the manner provided by law for the service of a summons and complaint and upon each nonresident member-party by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law.
(4) The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under subsection (2) is plenary and exclusive. If it so elects, the court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers shall have the powers described in the order appointing them or in an amendment to the order. The members demanding appraisal rights are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings. There is no right to a jury trial.
(5) Each member who is made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment for the amount of the fair value of such member’s membership interests, plus interest, as found by the court.
(6) The limited liability company shall pay each such member the amount found to be due within 10 days after final determination of the proceedings. Upon payment of the judgment, the member ceases to have any interest in the membership interests.
History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180.
605.1070 Court costs and attorney fees.—
(1) The court in an appraisal proceeding shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court. The court shall assess the costs against the limited liability company, except that the court may assess costs against all or some of the members demanding appraisal, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds the members acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this chapter.
(2) The court in an appraisal proceeding may also assess the expenses incurred by the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable:
(a) Against the limited liability company and in favor of any or all members demanding appraisal, if the court finds the limited liability company did not substantially comply with the requirements of ss. 605.1061-605.1072; or
(b) Against either the limited liability company or a member demanding appraisal, in favor of another party, if the court finds that the party against whom the expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this chapter.
(3) If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the expenses incurred by any member were of substantial benefit to other members similarly situated and should not be assessed against the limited liability company, the court may direct that the expenses be paid out of the amounts awarded the members who were benefited.
(4) To the extent the limited liability company fails to make a required payment pursuant to s. 605.1067 or s. 605.1069, the member may sue the limited liability company directly for the amount owed and, to the extent successful, is entitled to recover from the limited liability company all costs and expenses of the suit, including attorney fees.

605.1071 Limitation on limited liability company payment.—
(1) Payment may not be made to a member seeking appraisal rights if, at the time of payment, the limited liability company is unable to meet the distribution standards of s. 605.0405. In such event, the member shall, at the member’s option:
(a) Withdraw the notice of intent to assert appraisal rights, which is deemed withdrawn with the consent of the limited liability company; or
(b) Retain the status as a claimant against the limited liability company and, if the limited liability company is liquidated, be subordinated to the rights of creditors of the limited liability company, but have rights superior to the members not asserting appraisal rights and, if the limited liability company is not liquidated, retain the right to be paid for the membership interest, which right the limited liability company shall be obligated to satisfy when the restrictions of this section do not apply.
(2) The member shall exercise the option under paragraph (1)(a) or paragraph (1)(b) by written notice filed with the limited liability company within 30 days after the limited liability company has given written notice that the payment for the membership interests cannot be made because of the restrictions of this section. If the member fails to exercise the option, the member is deemed to have withdrawn the notice of intent to assert appraisal rights.

605.1103 Tax exemption on income of certain limited liability companies.—
(1) A limited liability company classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, or a single-member limited liability company that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes, and organized pursuant to this chapter or qualified to do business in this state as a foreign limited liability company is not an “artificial entity” within the purview of s. 220.02 and is not subject to the tax imposed under chapter 220. If a single-member limited liability company is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes, its activities are, for purposes of taxation under chapter 220, treated in the same manner as a sole proprietorship, branch, or division of the owner.
(2) For purposes of taxation under chapter 220, a limited liability company formed in this state or a foreign limited liability company with a certificate of authority to transact business in this state shall be classified as a partnership or a limited liability company that has only one member shall be disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for federal income tax purposes, unless classified otherwise for federal income tax purposes, in which case the limited liability company shall be classified identically to its classification for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of taxation under chapter 220, a member or a transferee of a member of a limited liability company formed in this state or a foreign limited liability company with a certificate of authority to transact business in this state shall be treated as a resident or nonresident partner unless classified otherwise for federal income tax purposes, in which case the member or transferee of a member has the same status as the member or transferee of a member for federal income tax purposes.
(3) Single-member limited liability companies and other entities that are disregarded for federal income tax purposes must be treated as separate legal entities for all non-income tax purposes. The Department of Revenue shall adopt rules to take into account that single-member disregarded entities such as limited liability companies and qualified subchapter S corporations may be disregarded as separate entities for federal tax purposes and therefore may report and account for income, employment, and other taxes under the taxpayer identification number of the owner of the single-member entity.

605.1104 Interrogatories by department; other powers of department.—
(1) The department may direct to any limited liability company or foreign limited liability company subject to this chapter, and to a member or manager of any limited liability company or foreign limited liability company subject to this chapter, interrogatories reasonably necessary and proper to enable the department to ascertain whether the limited liability company or foreign limited liability company has complied with the provisions of this chapter applicable to the limited liability company or foreign limited liability company. The interrogatories must be answered within 30 days after the date of mailing, or within such additional time as fixed by the department. The answers to the interrogatories must be full and complete and must be made in writing and under oath. If the interrogatories are directed to an individual, they must be answered by the individual, and if directed to a limited liability company or foreign limited liability company, they must be answered by a manager of a manager-managed company, a member of a member-managed company, or other applicable governor if a foreign limited liability company is not member-managed or manager managed, or a fiduciary if the company is in the hands of a receiver, trustee, or other court-appointed fiduciary.
(2) The department need not file a record in a court of competent jurisdiction to which the interrogatories relate until the interrogatories are answered as provided in this chapter, and is not required to file a record if the answers disclose that the record is not in conformity with the requirements of this chapter or if the department has determined that the parties to such document have not paid all fees, taxes, and penalties due and owing this state. The department shall certify to the Department of Legal Affairs, for such action as the Department of Legal Affairs may deem appropriate, all interrogatories and answers that disclose a violation of this chapter.
(3) The department may, based upon its findings under this section or as provided in s. 213.053(15), bring an action in circuit court to collect any penalties, fees, or taxes determined to be due and owing the state and to compel any filing, qualification, or registration required by law. In connection with such proceeding, the department may, without prior approval by the court, file a lis pendens against any property owned by the limited liability company and may further certify any findings to the Department of Legal Affairs for the initiation of an action permitted pursuant to this chapter which the Department of Legal Affairs may deem appropriate.
