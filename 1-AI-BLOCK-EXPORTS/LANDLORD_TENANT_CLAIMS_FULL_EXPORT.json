    "content": "Count I: Fraudulent Misrepresentation\n\nPlaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.\n\nThis is an action for fraudulent misrepresentation arising from Defendants\u2019 deliberate use of a fictitious, unregistered business name to collect Florida rent payments in violation of state law, under false pretenses, and with intent to deceive.\n\n1.\u2003Defendants Luther J. Rollins Jr., an attorney, and Mary O. Polk, jointly executed a lease agreement with Plaintiff on October 24, 2023, for residential property in Gulfport, Florida.\n\n2.\u2003The lease identified only Rollins and Polk as landlords. No business entity or assumed name was disclosed. No reference was made to \u201cAmarlu Enterprises,\u201d \u201cAmarlu Company,\u201d or \u201cAmarlu Consulting.\u201d\n\n3.\u2003Plaintiff paid $13,500 via cashier\u2019s checks to Luther Rollins personally for first month\u2019s rent, last month\u2019s rent, and a refundable security deposit.\n\n4.\u2003Thereafter, Defendants instructed Plaintiff to make monthly rent payments to \u201cAmarlu Enterprises\u201d at a misleading address: \u201c231 Government Ave SW #3097,\u201d which disguised a USPS PO Box as a suite.\n\n5.\u2003\u201cAmarlu Enterprises\u201d is not and has never been a legally registered business. It is merely a fictitious business name filed in Catawba County, NC, not registered in Florida, with no EIN or corporate status.\n\n6.\u2003The use of an unregistered entity and a falsified address was a deliberate attempt to conceal the Defendants\u2019 personal involvement and to obstruct statutory service of legal notices under Fla. Stat. \u00a783.49.\n\n7.\u2003Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendants\u2019 representations and remitted $36,000 over eight months to a non-entity, unaware of its legal nonexistence.\n\n8.\u2003Defendants knowingly misled Plaintiff and structured the deception to obscure accountability and create procedural defenses.\n\n9.\u2003Defendants\u2019 conduct was intentional, malicious, and grossly negligent, warranting punitive damages.\n\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment for compensatory damages, punitive damages, interest, court costs, and any further relief deemed just and proper.",
