“This is a lease … between Luther J. Rollins, Jr. (name and address of owner of the property) 2649 Tifton St S, Gulfport, FL 33711 (‘Landlord’) …” DDRESSING OVERVIEW - BRIEF.pdf](file-service://file-VYN6XrgedD9CUpyqgRgBHH)

Rollins identifies the rental house as his own mailing address, immediately conflating landlord and tenant premises.

⸻

2 │ Page 2, Section 2 “Property Rented”

“Landlord leases to Tenant the land and buildings located at 2649 Tifton St S (street address) Gulfport, Florida 33711‑3644 

Here the same address is correctly used to describe the premises, but because it already appears as the landlord’s address, the distinction between “property” and “landlord contact” disappears.

⸻

3 │ Page 3, Section 5 “Money Due Prior to Occupancy”

“Any funds due under this paragraph shall be payable to Landlord at Landlord’s address or to Luther Rollins … at 2649 Tifton St S, Gulfport, FL 33711.”

Tenants must mail pre‑occupancy money to their own dwelling, a logistical and legal anomaly that defeats the purpose of providing a separate remittance address.

⸻

4 │ Page 4, Section 8 “Notices”

“All notices must be sent to ‘Landlord’ at ‘Landlord Address’ at 2649 Tifton St S …” 

Statutory notices (e.g., repair demands, deposit disputes) would go to the tenant’s front door, undermining proof of delivery and potentially voiding notice periods.

⸻

5 │ Page 4, Section 10 “Maintenance”

“Tenant shall notify Luther Rollins … at 2649 Tifton St S … of maintenance and repair requests.” 

Even emergency maintenance requests are routed to the rental address itself, delaying response and blurring responsibility.

⸻

Why this matters in the broader pattern:

Mirror‑image of the mailbox ruse. Elsewhere Rollins disguises post‑office boxes as suites (for rent checks) or mis‑labels his Hickory residence as a “P.O. Box.” Here he flips the tactic, turning the tenant’s residence into the landlord’s contact address.  Both maneuvers sow confusion about where legal mail really belongs.

Statutory non‑compliance. Florida Statute § 83.49(3)(a) and § 715.104 require a landlord to give a distinct, verifiable mailing address for notices and deposit disputes.  Using the leased property itself fails that test and can invalidate claim letters or shorten the landlord’s time to sue.  The pattern is identical to the certified‑mail problem at the Hickory P.O. box, reinforcing a continuous course of bad‑faith address manipulation. 

Evidence of intent. Because the form supplied five separate blanks for a landlord address—and Rollins filled each with the tenant’s dwelling—this is unlikely to be oversight.  It supports an inference that the address choices across all documents (deeds, payment envelopes, security‑deposit notices, and the lease) are conscious strategies to control or frustrate legal communications.

⸻

Practical next step

Obtain an affidavit from the Gulfport post‑office or a process‑server statement confirming that certified mail addressed to 2649 Tifton St S cannot be signed by the landlord unless the tenant forwards it.  Coupled with the lease excerpts above, that evidence will strengthen any claim of statutory violation or deceptive practice.




------

Pinellas general‑warranty deed – the granting clause states that the grantees’ “post‑office address is 420 18th Avenue Lane NW, Hickory NC 28601.”
That line mis‑identifies a brick‑and‑mortar residence as a P.O. box, exactly the inverse of the Gulfport rent envelopes that disguise a post‑office box as a street‑level suite.  The contradiction strengthens the inference that Rollins toggles the label—street or P.O. Box—to suit his tactical needs.

Why it matters
	1.	Consistent with prior instances:
	•	2020 North‑Carolina deed: “seller is residence” box ticked for an LLC.
	•	Security‑deposit notice: reply address shown without “P.O. Box,” causing certified mail to mis‑route.
	•	Certified envelope sent only after a tenant complained finally adds the “P.O.” tag—proof Rollins knows the correct format.
	2.	Bad‑faith inference:  Using “post‑office address” language for a street residence can mislead courts and tenants about the correct venue for service, satisfying the “material misrepresentation” element in both Florida’s fraudulent‑record statute and North‑Carolina’s false‑entry statute.
	3.	Pattern continuity:  The Hickory deed prepared by Attorney Williams does say “P.O. Box 3739,” showing the drafter follows post‑office conventions.  Rollins departs from that convention when it benefits him, reinforcing intent rather than accident.

I’ll update the narrative sections so this new Pinellas deed wording joins the list of address irregularities.

Confirming the “231 Government Ave, Hickory NC 28603” address


- USPS location data. The single United States Postal Service facility in Hickory that carries the ZIP code 28603 is the Main Post Office at 231 Government Avenue SW.  Public USPS and mapping pages list that building only as retail and P.O.‑box space; it has no street‑delivery customer service  

	- A “Unit number” or “#‑box” therefore denotes an interior post‑office box, not a suite in a commercial building.



How the address appears on different documents


1. Williams Law Firm on the April 7th, 2020 North Carolina General Warranty Deed. 

The preparer block reads “The Williams Attorneys at Law, PLLC, P.O. Box 3739, Hickory NC 28603.”  By explicitly stating P.O. Box the lawyer discloses that filings and certified mail must be delivered inside the post‑office lobby.  (See the footer of the recorded deed page)

2. Rollins on Gulfport rent paperwork. In the statutory security‑deposit notice he served on the tenants, the reply address is “LUTHER ROLLINS, AMARLU Enterprises, 231 Government Ave SW #‑3097, Hickory NC 28603”—with no “P.O. Box” label 


3. Rollins on the certified‑mail envelope. After the tenant alerted him that certified mail was being rejected, the envelope he posted shows, for the first time,
“P.O. # 3097” on the second line beneath “231 Government Ave SW” UTH-PO BOX USED-USPS ENVELOPE.pdf] That late correction confirms the box is inside the post office.



Why the omission matters


1. Service‑of‑process risk: 

Certified letters addressed to “231 Government Ave SW #3097” without the “P.O. Box” tag generate USPS “bad address” scans and are often returned unless someone intercepts them at the counter—as happened with the tenant’s dispute letter.  A lawyer‑landlord who intentionally leaves off “P.O. Box” forces tenants to guess how to serve objections within Florida’s fifteen‑day deadline, potentially forfeiting their rights.

Okay, I will refine the analysis of Luther Rollins' pattern of address misuse, incorporating all the details you've provided and structuring it for clarity and legal impact.

Analysis of Pattern of Deceptive Address Practices

This analysis details a consistent and deliberate pattern of deceptive address practices employed by Luther J. Rollins, Jr. across both North Carolina and Florida, demonstrating a disregard for statutory requirements and contributing to claims of bad faith and misrepresentation.

Instances of Address Misuse:

North Carolina PO Box Omission: Luther Rollins systematically omitted the designation "PO Box" when referencing his Hickory, North Carolina address (231 Government Ave SW, #3097, Hickory, NC 28603) in official communications related to the Florida rental property. This practice deviates from standard address formatting and appears intended to obscure the nature of the address.

Misrepresentation in Florida Property Deed: In the 2020 Warranty Deed transferring ownership of the Gulfport, Florida rental property from JTB LLC to Luther Rollins, Jr., the document incorrectly identifies his personal home address (420 18th Ave Ln NW, Hickory, NC 28601) as a PO Box. This misrepresentation occurs in a formal legal document related to property ownership.

Inappropriate Use of Florida Rental Address: In the lease agreement for the Gulfport, Florida property, Luther Rollins inappropriately listed the tenant's rental address (2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL 33711) as his own "Landlord Address" in five separate instances. This violates Florida Statute § 83.50, which requires landlords to disclose their actual address for service of process.

PO Box Omission in Security Deposit Claim Reply Address: When issuing the initial Claim on Security Deposit letter (Letter 1), Luther Rollins again omitted the "PO Box" designation in the reply address provided for Tenant Disputes (231 Government Ave SW, #3097, Hickory, NC 28603). This inconsistency, particularly in a time-sensitive statutory notice, caused confusion and triggered urgent notifications from USPS to the tenant regarding mislabeling and potential return-to-sender scenarios.

Inconsistent Address Formatting in Subsequent Letter: While the certified mailing envelope for the second letter (Letter 2) included the "P.O. Box #3097" designation, the body of Letter 2 itself omitted any return address entirely, forcing reliance on the envelope and demonstrating continued inconsistency in providing a clear address for communication.

Use of NC PO Box for Florida Rent Collection: Tenants were provided with pre-addressed, pre-stamped envelopes instructing them to make rent checks payable to Amarlu Enterprises and mail them to the North Carolina PO Box (231 Government Ave SW, #3097, Hickory, NC 28603). This practice funneled rental income from a Florida property to an out-of-state entity using an address formatted inconsistently and potentially in violation of NC business address requirements.

Purpose and Intent:

These repeated inconsistencies and misrepresentations regarding addresses across multiple documents and states suggest a deliberate strategy rather than simple oversight. The likely purposes include:

Obscuring Business Operations: Using a PO Box and omitting its designation, particularly in conjunction with the unregistered Amarlu Enterprises, appears intended to make it difficult to identify the true business location and responsible parties.

Evading Florida Statutory Requirements: Listing the Florida rental address as the landlord address in the lease violates disclosure laws and may have been an attempt to appear as a local landlord while operating from out of state via an unregistered entity.

Obstructing Tenant Communication and Legal Process: The incorrect and inconsistent addresses provided for tenant responses, particularly on the security deposit claim notice, appear designed to create confusion and potentially delay or invalidate the tenant's ability to exercise their statutory rights within required timeframes.

Misappropriating Federal Postal Facilities: The deliberate misuse of a federally owned Post Office and PO Box system for deceptive business practices raises concerns about the integrity of mail handling and potential federal violations.

Legal Implications:

This pattern of deceptive address practices has significant legal implications under Florida, North Carolina, and potentially federal law:

Florida Statute § 83.50 Violation: Listing the rental property address as the landlord's address in the lease is a direct violation of the requirement to provide a proper address for notices.

Florida Statute § 83.49(3)(b) Obstruction: Providing an incorrect or incomplete reply address on the security deposit claim notice, which caused delays in the tenant's response, interferes with the tenant's statutory rights under the security deposit law.

Florida Statute § 605.0902 Context: The use of the NC PO Box for collecting rent via the unregistered Amarlu Enterprises reinforces the claim that the landlord was conducting business in Florida through an unregistered foreign entity, in violation of state law.

North Carolina Business Address Violations: The omission of "PO Box" and potential misrepresentation of a physical address for business purposes may violate North Carolina business registration statutes (e.g., N.C.G.S. § 66-71.4).

Federal Postal Regulations: Misusing a PO Box or providing false address information for commercial purposes can violate federal postal regulations and potentially lead to mail fraud investigations if intent to defraud is established.

Evidence of Bad Faith: The cumulative pattern of inconsistent and deceptive address practices serves as strong evidence of the landlord's bad faith in the overall dispute, supporting claims for punitive damages and undermining the landlord's credibility in court.

Professional Misconduct: For Luther Rollins, Jr., as a licensed attorney, engaging in such deceptive practices violates professional ethics rules (e.g., Florida Bar Rule 4-8.4(c) and (d)) prohibiting dishonesty, misrepresentation, and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The contrast with the correctly formatted address used by The Williams Law Firm, another attorney with a neighboring PO Box, highlights that Rollins' actions deviate from standard, lawful practice within his own profession and location.

Conclusion:

The documented pattern of deceptive address practices by Luther J. Rollins, Jr. is not a series of isolated errors but a consistent approach to obscure information and potentially evade legal and tax obligations. These actions violate specific Florida and North Carolina statutes, federal postal regulations, and professional ethics standards for attorneys. This pattern serves as compelling evidence of bad faith, supporting claims for enhanced damages and regulatory scrutiny.


3. Regulatory interpretation:

Florida’s fraudulent‑record statute considers whether a filer “materially misrepresents” an address to hinder notice.  North‑Carolina’s false‑entry statute reaches the same conduct.  Using a postal facility yet omitting “P.O. Box” where space allows can be portrayed as a deliberate barrier to certified or sheriff’s service—especially when the drafter’s own filings show the correct convention.

Strengthening the case file

The newly uploaded security‑deposit notice and certified envelope demonstrate that:
	•	Rollins knows the address is a P.O. box (he finally wrote “P.O.” on the envelope after the tenant complained).
	•	He chose to exclude that label in the body of the legal notice that triggers the tenant’s fifteen‑day response clock.

Those facts tighten the “intent” element for any claim of fraudulent filing, mail obstruction, or unfair‑dealing under landlord–tenant statutes.  They also rebut any suggestion that the address anomaly was a clerical oversight, because the attorney who prepared the 2020 deed used the proper “P.O. Box” format while Rollins did not.

⸻

Next investigative step:  subpoena USPS box‑holder records for Box 3097; they will show when Rollins first rented it and whether it is listed under his personal name, AMARLU LLC, or both.  Matching the start date to the Gulfport lease timeline would further illustrate pre‑meditation in the address‑masking strategy.

1 │ Landlord‑address anomalies

*In every blank where the form asks for a landlord mailing address—five times across the first four pages—Rollins inserts the rented premises itself, 2649 Tifton St S.*ASE-PDF-AGREEMENT-PRIIZMO.pdf](file-service://file-1ZTEVJvJ5F5RYhBfVs597e)
	•	“Parties” clause: landlord name and address both read “2649 Tifton St S.”
	•	“Money due prior to occupancy”: pre‑move‑in funds payable to that same address.EASE-PDF-AGREEMENT-PRIIZMO.pdf](file-service://file-1ZTEVJvJ5F5RYhBfVs597e)
	•	“Notices” paragraph: statutory notices must be mailed to 2649 Tifton St S (city and ZIP omitted once).D ADDRESSING copy.pdf](file-service://file-81kXjZa5fqnQKAw2MCzzDd)
	•	“Maintenance” clause: repair requests go to 2649 Tifton St S.AD ADDRESSING copy.pdf](file-service://file-81kXjZa5fqnQKAw2MCzzDd)

Why it matters.
Florida Statute 83.49(3)(a) requires the landlord to mail any security‑deposit claim to the tenant’s “last known address”—and gives the tenant fifteen days to object “in writing … to the landlord’s address.” By conflating landlord and premises addresses, Rollins forces the tenant to serve objections at their own residence, undermining proof of delivery and arguably shortening the statutory response window. The dual use also conflicts with § 83.50, which obliges a landlord to keep records and provide a reliable address for service.

⸻

2 │ Security‑deposit compliance

The lease reproduces the statutory disclosure text from § 83.49 verbatim, but leaves two critical blanks empty:
	•	No banking depository is named.
	•	No statement appears explaining whether the deposit earns interest.

The omission violates § 83.49(2)(b), which obliges the landlord to disclose those details in writing within thirty days after receipt of the money. The defect is aggravated by the mis‑addressed claim letter that followed: Rollins’s notice demanded the full $4,500 deposit and told the tenants to send objections to 231 Government Ave SW #3097—again without “P.O. Box,” triggering USPS mis‑routing. The tenant’s need to warn Rollins by e‑mail that certified mail was being rejected is evidence of actual prejudice.

⸻

3 │ Rent and late‑fee structure
	•	Rent is $4,500 monthly, due the first.
	•	A late charge is set as “$____ (if blank, 4 % of the rent payment) for each rent payment made ___ days late …” The blank for the dollar amount is filled with nothing, so the default 4 % applies. If rent is $4,500, the late fee caps at $180 under § 83.46(1). No issues there.
	•	Payment instructions direct checks to Luther Rollins at the premises, repeating the address confusion.

⸻

4 │ Maintenance allocation

Every maintenance item—foundations, plumbing, HVAC, pest‑control—is assigned to “Landlord” by default. Tenants “shall notify Luther Rollins at 2649 Tifton St S” of repair requests. By giving a notice address identical to the premises, Rollins risks claiming he never received written repair requests left in his own mailbox—an argument Florida courts routinely reject as self‑serving.

⸻

5 │ Prohibited or risky clauses

Waiver‑of‑rights check.
Page 9 reproduces § 83.47(1) and § 83.48, confirming attorney‑fees reciprocity and voiding any waiver of statutory remedies. No explicit waiver appears elsewhere, so the lease skirts that pitfall.

Assignment clause.
Tenant may not assign unless the checkbox is marked. Standard.

Insurance‑in‑lieu‑of‑deposit addendum.
Page 12 references the new § 83.491 “fee in lieu of security deposit.” Rollins did not opt into the fee scheme; instead he took a conventional $4,500 deposit, so that boilerplate is harmless but further proof the form was adopted without tailoring.

⸻

6 │ Consistency with the emerging pattern
	1.	Address toggling—street address mis‑labelled as “post‑office” on the Pinellas deed, P.O.‑box masked as “Suite 3097” on rent envelopes, and now landlord address conflated with tenant premises.
	2.	Control of communication flow—repair requests, notices, deposits, and objections must all pass through addresses Rollins can selectively monitor.
	3.	Regulatory short‑cuts—deposit notice blanks left empty; mailbox label omitted; insecure route for certified mail.

Taken together these clauses confirm that the address games are intentional and central to Rollins’s strategy: they muddy statutory timelines, complicate service of process, and keep tenant funds and correspondence under his exclusive control.

⸻

7 │ Leverage points for a tenant claim
	•	Statutory damages for deposit mishandling. Failure to name a bank plus the mis‑addressed claim letter supports treble‑deposit recovery under § 83.49(3)(a).
	•	Declaratory judgment on invalid notice clause. A court can rule that any lease paragraph requiring notices to be mailed to the premises is unconscionable or void under § 83.47.
	•	Attorney‑fee entitlement. Because the lease adopts § 83.48 verbatim, the prevailing tenant will recover fees.
	•	Pattern evidence for punitive damages. Showing the same address tactic in deeds, rent instructions, claim letters, and the lease itself can satisfy the “willful and malicious” threshold.

⸻

Bottom‑line assessment

The lease’s most damaging flaw is procedural: by substituting the rental house for a bona‑fide landlord address, it frustrates every statutory notice the tenant may need to send—from repair demands to deposit objections. That choice is not an accident; it dovetails with Rollins’s broader use of post‑office boxes disguised as suites and street addresses disguised as post‑office boxes. The pattern underscores intentional evasion, supplies a solid statutory cause of action, and strengthens any argument for punitive damages or bar discipline.
