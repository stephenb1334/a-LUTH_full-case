SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: IMPROPER NOTICE
	•	Rollins failed to provide a legally compliant “Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit” as required by Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a). The notice lacked specific itemization, detailed reasons for deductions, and supporting documentation, such as receipts or photos. The use of vague language like “damage to walls” and “missing items” without specifics renders the notice insufficient.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: INCORRECT ADDRESS
	•	The notice included an incorrect zip code for the response address, delaying the tenant’s ability to respond within the statutory timeframe.

	•	Rollins withheld the entire security deposit of $4,500 without providing proper justification or evidence of damage.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE IN SUBSEQUENT LETTERS
	•	Despite claiming in his second letter that he has ample photos, witnesses, and documentation to support his claims, Rollins again failed to produce any such evidence.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: FAILURE TO PROVIDE NOTICE
	•	Rollins did not provide the required written notice to the tenant regarding personal property left behind, violating Fla. Stat. §715.104. He failed to specify the items left behind and offer a reasonable timeframe for retrieval.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: CONVERSION OF PROPERTY

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: SHIFTING BURDEN OF PROOF

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: MISREPRESENTATION OF ABANDONMENT
	•	Rollins used a partial quote of a text message to suggest the tenant abandoned the property, which is a misrepresentation and omission of the full context.

LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PREMISES
	•	Rollins neglected maintenance issues, such as a severely clogged kitchen sink, despite being notified. This forced the tenant to resolve the issue himself.

LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO ADDRESS SECURITY CONCERNS

	•	By failing to address the security concerns and maintenance issues, Rollins breached the implied warranty of habitability under Fla. Stat. §83.51.

LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT: UNWANTED COMMUNICATION

PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT & ETHICAL VIOLATIONS: MISREPRESENTATION AS A LAWYER

PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT & ETHICAL VIOLATIONS: VIOLATIONS OF FLORIDA BAR RULES
	•	As an attorney, Rollins’ actions may violate the Florida Bar Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rule 4-8.4(c) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty or misrepresentation) and Rule 4-8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).

LACK OF TRANSPARENCY & BAD FAITH: FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE
	•	Despite claiming to possess photos, receipts, and witness accounts, Rollins failed to provide any supporting documentation to substantiate his claims, even after multiple opportunities.

LACK OF TRANSPARENCY & BAD FAITH: ARBITRARY SETTLEMENT OFFER
	•	Rollins made an arbitrary settlement offer of $2,000, which lacks any legal basis and does not address the full extent of his liabilities.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: DAMAGE TO WALLS
	•	The landlord claims damage to walls without specifying the nature, location, or extent of the damage. The tenant denies causing any damage beyond normal wear and tear, which tenants are not responsible for under Florida law.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: REMOVAL OF FIXTURES
	•	The landlord claims the tenant removed wood cabinets, shelving, and counters without prior written consent. The tenant acknowledges removing temporary fixtures installed for organization but was prepared to restore the premises or compensate, but his attempts to communicate were ignored.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: EXCESSIVE GARBAGE
	•	The landlord claims there was excessive garbage and trash left on the premises. The tenant explains that any trash was due to a delay in garbage collection caused by a severe storm and that all trash was placed in the designated area.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: SPOILED FOOD
	•	The landlord claims spoiled food was left in the refrigerator. The tenant responds that any remaining food items were minimal and did not cause damage and that minor cleaning is considered normal turnover.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: MISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS
	•	The landlord alleges missing and damaged artwork, furnishings, and housewares. However, this claim is unenforceable due to the lack of an initial, detailed inventory list.

ALLEGED ABANDONMENT OF PROPERTY: MISREPRESENTATION OF TEXT MESSAGE
	•	The landlord attempts to mischaracterize a text message from the tenant as an indication that he had abandoned his personal property, but the tenant’s response clarifies the full context of the message, showing intent to retrieve his belongings.

FAILURE TO MAKE REPAIRS: TENANT’S PROACTIVE ACTIONS
	•	The tenant is accused of not making necessary repairs to the property. However, the tenant was forced to take on these repairs due to the landlord’s negligence in the first place, such as the clogged sink, making him justifiably responsible for some issues that would have been the landlord’s responsibility if he had acted proactively.

LANDLORD VIOLATION OF STATUTE 83.67
	•	Landlords are prohibited from converting tenant property for personal use or failing to notify tenants in writing about the status of abandoned personal property. Rollins’ actions are in direct violation of this statute.

LANDLORD VIOLATION OF STATUTE 715.109

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: USE OF FUTURE TENSE
	•	The landlord’s notice uses speculative language about future costs and implies that repairs will be necessary. Florida law requires landlords to provide actual costs incurred, not speculative future expenses.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: ABSENCE OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
	•	The landlord’s notice fails to include any supporting documentation such as photographs, receipts, or invoices to substantiate the claims.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: NO BASELINE FOR COMPARISON
	•	Without an initial, itemized inventory, it is impossible to substantiate claims of missing or damaged items. There is no baseline against which to compare the condition of the property at the end of the tenancy.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: UNREASONABLE ACCOUNTABILITY
	•	Holding the tenant accountable for items that were never clearly defined or documented at the start of the tenancy is unreasonable and potentially unlawful.

- **FAILURE TO DISCLOSE:**
  - Rollins failed to disclose the financial institution holding the security deposit, whether it was interest-bearing, or whether he owns five or more properties, as required by Fla. Stat. §83.49.

- **UNLAWFUL DEDUCTIONS:**

  - He did not itemize the abandoned property or offer a reasonable timeframe for retrieval.

  - The full context shows the tenant intended to reclaim belongings, making the landlord’s representation misleading.

- **VIOLATIONS OF FLORIDA BAR RULES:**
  - As an attorney, Rollins’ conduct may violate Rule 4-8.4(c) (prohibiting dishonesty, fraud, deceit, misrepresentation) and Rule 4-8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to justice).

- **MISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS:**

  - With no initial inventory provided, such claims lack a baseline, making them unenforceable.

### ALLEGED ABANDONMENT OF PROPERTY:

- **MISREPRESENTATION OF TEXT MESSAGE:**
  - Landlord tries to paint a text message as abandonment of property.
  - Full context shows the tenant intended retrieval, not abandonment.

### FAILURE TO MAKE REPAIRS:

- **TENANT’S PROACTIVE ACTIONS:**
  - The tenant took on repairs (like unclogging the sink) only because Rollins ignored the tenant’s maintenance requests.
  - The tenant’s forced role in maintenance underscores the landlord’s negligence.

  - Rollins’ noncompliance triggers this liability.

### CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES:

- **VAGUE AND LACKING:**
  - The landlord’s initial deposit claim letter lacked itemized specifics, photographs, or invoices.
  - This violates statutory standards.

- **USE OF FUTURE TENSE:**
  - The landlord’s use of speculative language about “needed repairs” does not justify present withholdings.
  - Florida law requires proof of actual costs incurred.

- **ABSENCE OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:**
  - Without receipts, photos, or invoices, the landlord’s claims are unsubstantiated.

- **NO BASELINE FOR COMPARISON:**
  - Without an initial, itemized inventory list, any claim of missing or damaged items fails.
  - No starting condition means no measure of alleged changes.

- **UNREASONABLE ACCOUNTABILITY:**
  - Holding the tenant accountable for items never clearly documented at move-in is unreasonable and potentially unlawful.

-------

**Key Highlights:**

- **Legal Violations:** Multiple claims reference specific Florida statutes (e.g., Fla. Stat. §83.49, Fla. Stat. §715.104, Fla. Stat. §83.51), underscoring the legal basis for each allegation against Rollins.

- **Pattern of Negligence and Misconduct:** The repeated failures in communication, maintenance, and ethical conduct indicate a consistent pattern of negligence and possible intentional misconduct.

- **Misrepresentation as a Lawyer:**
  - **License Jurisdiction Issue:** Rollins is a licensed attorney in North Carolina, not Florida. Using an email address like “luther2law@gmail.com” in a Florida legal matter may mislead the tenant into believing he is authorized to practice law in Florida, potentially violating professional conduct standards.
  - **Intimidation Tactics:** By implying legal expertise or representation through his email and communications, Rollins may be engaging in unethical behavior aimed at intimidating or misleading the tenant, thereby exerting undue pressure during the dispute.

- **Evidence and Documentation Issues:** The lack of proper documentation and evidence from Rollins severely undermines his claims, providing a stronger position for the tenant in any legal proceedings.

- **Emotional and Physical Impact:** Claims related to harassment and emotional distress highlight the adverse effects of Rollins’ actions on the tenant’s well-being, potentially justifying claims for emotional damages.

- **Professional Ethical Concerns:** As an attorney, Rollins’ alleged violations of the Florida Bar Rules amplify the severity of his misconduct, possibly leading to professional disciplinary actions in addition to tenant claims.

1. General Denial & Self-Characterization by Landlord

Landlord’s Claim: States disagreement with allegations, and asserts having acted lawfully, with “kindness” and “professionalism.”

Landlord's Quote: “I disagree with and deny all your allegations… I always treated you with kindness, empathy, professionalism, and regard for the law.”
• Law: Under Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 83.51, the landlord must strictly follow statutory requirements for deposit handling, notice, and habitability—personal opinions do not override these mandates.

• Fact: Despite claims of professionalism, the landlord failed to provide timely, itemized documentation for withholding the security deposit and did not address key maintenance and security issues during the tenancy.

• Conclusion: Subjective self-assessments do not nullify legal obligations. The landlord’s noncompliance with statutory duties exposes them to liability for the full disputed amount ($8,710.62) plus potential enhanced damages.

2. Emotional Appeal & Surprise at the Dispute

Landlord’s Claim: Expresses disappointment and surprise at the dispute.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3) requires a detailed, timely response by the landlord regardless of personal feelings.
• Fact: The landlord did not meet statutory obligations for itemization and timely communication. Emotional surprise does not relieve a landlord from complying with Florida law.
• Conclusion: Personal disappointment is irrelevant. By failing to properly document claims, the landlord faces potential treble damages and punitive damages if they continue to refuse compliance.

3. Allegation of Inaccuracy or Exaggeration

Landlord’s Claim: Suggests tenant’s statements are inaccurate or exaggerated.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) obligates the landlord to present itemized, timely evidence of damage. Without compliance, the landlord’s denials are legally insufficient.
• Fact: The landlord offered no itemized receipts, invoices, or before-and-after photographs within the statutory timeframe.
• Conclusion: Courts, such as in Johnson v. Baker, rule against landlords who cannot substantiate claims. Without timely evidence, withholding the deposit is unlawful, making the landlord liable for the full amount and potential additional damages.

4. Signed Lease Existence

Landlord’s Claim: References having the signed lease.
• Law: A signed lease does not exempt the landlord from meeting Fla. Stat. §§83.49, 83.51 (habitable condition, proper deposit handling), and §§715.10–715.111 (personal property rights).
• Fact: Regardless of the lease, the landlord must still provide timely notice and adhere to statutory mandates for deposit returns and personal property handling.
• Conclusion: Possessing the lease is irrelevant to the landlord’s statutory noncompliance, reinforcing tenant’s right to a full refund and additional remedies.

5. Inventory List Signed by Melissa

Landlord’s Claim: States having an inventory signed by Melissa.
• Law: Johnson v. Baker and Fla. Stat. §83.49(3) require a properly executed, itemized inventory from the outset. Without it, the landlord cannot prove which items were damaged or missing at move-out.
• Fact: No such mutually agreed-upon, properly integrated inventory was provided at move-in. Any post-hoc claim is untimely and legally ineffective.
• Conclusion: Without a recognized inventory baseline, the landlord cannot prove damages or missing items. The time to produce such evidence is past, negating their claim.

6. Photos and Evidence Claims

Landlord’s Claim: Asserts having photos of the premises before and after.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) demands timely, itemized evidence. Landlords who fail to produce contemporaneous documentation for damages cannot later justify deposit withholding.
• Fact: The landlord did not provide these photos with the initial claim, missing the statutory deadline.
• Conclusion: Without timely disclosure, any newly mentioned evidence is legally void. The landlord’s failure to comply exposes them to owing the full amount plus statutory penalties.

7. Witnesses to Condition & Alleged Negligence

Landlord’s Claim: Says witnesses can testify to the condition and negligence.
• Law: Florida courts require timely, credible, and properly presented evidence. Generic witness claims, without sworn statements or affidavits produced at the proper time, have no legal weight.
• Fact: No sworn statements or affidavits were provided during the statutory timeframe.
• Conclusion: Unverified witness references do not cure the landlord’s procedural failures. They remain liable for return of the full deposit and other damages.

8. Receipts for Alleged Damaged Items & Garbage Removal

Landlord’s Claim: Has receipts for removal of damaged items or trash.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) requires these receipts be provided within the initial claim period.
• Fact: The landlord failed to include these receipts at the time of the original deposit claim.
• Conclusion: Attempting to justify withholding after the fact is legally impermissible. The landlord’s noncompliance solidifies the tenant’s claim.

9. Texts Allegedly Contradicting Tenant’s Claims

Landlord’s Claim: Possesses texts from tenant contradicting their claims.
• Law: All relevant evidence must be disclosed and itemized per Fla. Stat. §83.49(3). The landlord cannot surprise the tenant later with undisclosed texts.
• Fact: No such texts were provided timely. The tenant’s communications consistently show attempts to maintain and retrieve personal property lawfully.
• Conclusion: Undisclosed texts are legally irrelevant now. The landlord’s failure to produce them earlier forfeits their evidentiary value.

10. September 4th Text About Leaving Town

Landlord’s Claim: Misquotes tenant’s message to imply abandonment.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §715.104 mandates that the landlord issue written notice before considering property abandoned.
• Fact: The landlord never provided the required abandonment notice. The tenant’s full text shows intent to retrieve belongings, not abandon them.
• Conclusion: Selective quoting is bad faith. By ignoring statutory abandonment procedures, the landlord risks treble damages and punitive damages.

11. Phone Records & No Calls Argument

Landlord’s Claim: States tenant never called to retrieve property.
• Law: Florida statutes rely on written notice and proper documentation, not phone calls.
• Fact: The tenant repeatedly made written requests for retrieving personal property, which the landlord ignored.
• Conclusion: Phone logs are immaterial. The landlord’s disregard for written requests and statutory obligations cements their liability.

12. Uncertainty About Personal Property & Alleged Delivery After Lease

Landlord’s Claim: Cannot confirm property presence, denies conversion.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §§715.10–715.111 require landlords to issue a written notice and allow tenants to recover possessions. Marketing tenant’s items as amenities constitutes conversion.
• Fact: The landlord failed to provide required abandonment notices and used tenant’s grill for the rental listing.
• Conclusion: Uncertainty does not excuse conversion. Unauthorized use of tenant’s property may result in treble damages, punitive damages, and compensation for emotional distress.

13. Counteroffer of 500 for Personal Property

Landlord’s Offer: Proposes 1,500 deposit + 
§
4,500 deposit plus 8,710.62), tenant will pursue maximum damages in court, including treble and punitive damages.

14. Willingness to Talk or Mediate

Landlord’s Claim: Suggests informal settlement or mediation.
• Law: Landlord must first comply with Fla. Stat. §§83.49, 83.51, and 715.10–715.111 before proposing resolution.
• Fact: The landlord’s repeated noncompliance and failure to meet basic statutory requirements negates the need for further informal discussions.
• Conclusion: Without immediate full payment, there is no basis for mediation. Continued refusal triggers litigation and pursuit of full statutory remedies.

15. Impact of Hurricanes & Personal Circumstances

Landlord’s Claim: References hurricane impacts and personal challenges.
• Law: Fla. Stat. §§83.49, 83.51, 715.10–715.111 do not provide exceptions for hardship. Statutory deadlines and requirements remain binding.
• Fact: The landlord never sought extensions or provided explanations at the time compliance was due.
• Conclusion: External factors do not excuse statutory breaches. The landlord remains fully liable for the full amount plus any enhanced damages.

Final Demand and Deadline

After reviewing all claims:
• The landlord repeatedly failed to provide timely, itemized evidence or comply with abandonment procedures.
• The tenant seeks full compensation: $8,710.62 (security deposit + personal property).
• Noncompliance exposes the landlord to treble damages under Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 715.104, plus punitive damages for willful misconduct and emotional distress compensation.
• Provide a 15-day deadline from receipt of this final communication to pay the full amount.
• If payment is not received, the tenant will proceed to circuit court and seek maximum allowable damages.

-----old------

General Denial & Self-Characterization
Landlord’s Claim: “I disagree with and deny all your allegations… I always treated you with kindness, empathy, professionalism, and regard for the law.”

Law: Under Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 83.51, a landlord’s legal responsibilities are objective and not subject to personal interpretation. The law mandates proper handling of security deposits, timely notice, safe housing conditions, and adherence to statutory procedures for any personal property left behind. Your subjective view of your behavior cannot override these statutory directives

Fact: Despite your claim of kindness and professionalism, you failed to provide an itemized statement of deductions from the security deposit within the statutory timeframe, did not ensure proper safety and habitability measures after a documented break-in, and neglected to follow the procedures required by Fla. Stat. §§715.10–715.111 regarding abandoned or unclaimed personal property. Your failure to meet these objective legal criteria is well-documented and not mitigated by any personal sentiment.

Conclusion: Your personal feelings and self-assessment do not exempt you from meeting rigid statutory obligations. Florida law is clear and unambiguous: you must comply with the statutes governing deposit returns, maintenance, and personal property handling. Having not done so, your claim of “regard for the law” collapses under the weight of your demonstrable noncompliance. No amount of subjective “kindness” changes these objective legal failures.

Emotional Appeal & Surprise at the Dispute
Landlord’s Claim: “I never imagined that our relationship would end in any sort of dispute… surprised, disappointed, and somewhat disheartened.”

Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3) mandates strict compliance with notice and documentation requirements related to security deposits, and Fla. Stat. §83.51 addresses the landlord’s duty to maintain a habitable property. Surprise or disappointment does not alter or delay these legal imperatives.

Fact: You were legally required to provide prompt, itemized justifications for any deposit withholding at the conclusion of the tenancy. You did not. You were required to maintain the property in a safe and habitable condition, including addressing known security risks post-break-in. You failed. These are statutory duties that do not vanish simply because you did not anticipate a conflict.

Conclusion: Your emotional response is immaterial. Statutory obligations persist regardless of your expectations or personal feelings. The dispute arose because you did not adhere to the specific legal steps required, not because I unfairly sought a confrontation. Under Florida law, the landlord’s compliance or noncompliance determines outcomes, not emotional sentiments.

Allegation of Inaccuracy or Exaggeration
Landlord’s Claim: “Much of what you say is not accurate and/or exaggerated.”

Law: Under Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a), a landlord must provide an itemized list of damages claimed against the deposit within the statutory timeframe, accompanied by supporting evidence. Without timely, concrete evidence, the landlord’s withholding is presumptively unlawful.

Fact: You have not presented timely, itemized evidence. Instead of addressing the specific factual inaccuracies you allege, you rely on vague denials without producing the statutorily required documentation (e.g., detailed receipts, properly executed inventories, time-stamped photographs). Your general claim of “inaccuracy” thus stands unsupported and legally insufficient.

Conclusion: In the absence of timely, legally compliant evidence, the law defaults to protecting the tenant’s deposit. Calling my claims inaccurate without furnishing the requisite proof at the required time fails to meet the legal standard Florida law imposes. Your credibility and position erode further each time you invoke unsupported allegations of exaggeration without the documentation the statutes demand.

Signed Lease
Landlord’s Claim: “I have a copy of the written lease signed by you.”

Law: While the lease establishes our contractual relationship, Fla. Stat. §§83.49, 83.51, and §§715.10–715.111 impose statutory duties separate from lease terms. No clause in the lease can diminish or negate these statutory obligations.

Fact: Possession of a signed lease merely confirms we had a landlord-tenant relationship. It does not justify withholding the deposit without following statutory processes or failing to provide the maintenance and safety measures required by law. Nor does it excuse your failure to follow the formal procedures outlined in the statutes governing personal property retrieval.

Conclusion: The existence of a signed lease is not a shield against statutory noncompliance. It does not nullify your obligation to send proper notices, itemized breakdowns, and comply with security and maintenance standards. By failing to meet these duties, you remain in violation of Florida law, regardless of having a signed lease in hand.

Inventory List Signed by Melissa
Landlord’s Claim: “I have a copy of the inventory signed by Melissa when you moved in.”
__
Law: Pursuant to Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) and case law such as Johnson v. Baker, a landlord must establish a verified baseline condition of the property to justify later damage claims. Such an inventory must be properly executed, fully acknowledged by all parties (including both tenants), and integrated into the lease at the outset.

Fact: I never reviewed, signed, or agreed to any inventory list, and it was never attached as a mutually acknowledged lease addendum. You have not shown that this alleged inventory was lawfully incorporated at move-in, nor provided at any appropriate point to establish a baseline for damage claims. Without my signature and the proper formalization, the alleged inventory list fails to meet the evidentiary standards Florida law requires for damage justification.

Conclusion: An alleged inventory that was never fully executed by all parties and never integrated into the lease documents at the appropriate time is legally meaningless. Without a legitimate, verified baseline condition documented at move-in, you cannot credibly assert tenant-caused damages later. Any claim based on this alleged inventory is legally void.

I am not offering another informal chance for you to fix this evidentiary gap. Either promptly pay the full $8,710.62 owed or face the consequences in circuit court, where the burden of your statutory failures may be met with treble and punitive damages.

Photos and Evidence Claims
Landlord’s Claim: “I have photos of the premises before and after…”

Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) demands timely, itemized evidence accompanying the initial deposit claim. Merely claiming to have photos after-the-fact is legally insufficient.

Fact: If these photos genuinely showed tenant-caused damage, you should have presented them immediately during the statutory notice period, not long after. Your failure to do so when legally required to proves these alleged images cannot retroactively justify deposit deductions. They do not meet the stringent procedural and evidentiary requirements established by Florida law.

Conclusion: Late claims of possessing photographic evidence carry no legal weight. You missed the statutory window to present them as part of a valid, itemized damages statement. Without adherence to procedural timelines, such evidence is now rendered moot, leaving your withholding of the deposit unsupported and unlawful.

Witnesses to Condition & Alleged Negligence
Landlord’s Claim: “I have witnesses to the condition… witnesses to your negligent treatment…”

Law: Florida courts require objective, contemporaneous evidence that aligns with statutory requirements, not vague witness references. Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) places the onus on you to timely and properly document damages.

Fact: You have not named these witnesses, produced sworn affidavits, or shown how their testimony corroborates a properly itemized and timely damage claim. Without official statements tied to statutory notice requirements, unnamed witness claims fail as legitimate evidence.

Conclusion: Unspecified witnesses cannot remedy statutory noncompliance. The legal process demands documented, timely, and admissible evidence. Vague mentions of witnesses do not salvage your case from the statutory failures you have already committed.

Receipts for Alleged Damaged Items & Garbage Removal
Landlord’s Claim: “I have receipts for removal of excessively damaged items…”

Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) mandates that landlords provide itemized costs and supporting documentation within the legally specified timeframe.

Fact: You never presented these receipts in a timely manner. Attempting to rely on them now violates both the letter and spirit of the statutes designed to protect tenants from after-the-fact justifications. The law does not permit you to produce critical evidence at your convenience; deadlines and procedures exist for a reason.

Conclusion: Your belated mention of receipts is irrelevant. You forfeited the legal right to use such evidence by not disclosing it at the required time. Absent timely compliance, you cannot retroactively legitimize your deductions.

Texts Allegedly Contradicting My Claims
Landlord’s Claim: “I have texts from you that contradict your Response claims.”

Law: Under Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a), you must promptly provide documentation that justifies withholding my deposit. You must also comply with Fla. Stat. §715.104 for personal property handling.

Fact: If these texts were genuinely exculpatory or indicative of tenant abandonment, you should have included them in your initial claim or promptly upon disputing my demands. Instead, you merely assert their existence without producing them as timely evidence.

Conclusion: Late, unverified claims about having contradictory texts hold no weight. Courts and statutes require immediate and transparent evidence. Without producing such texts in a legally compliant manner, you fail to refute my claims or justify your actions, leaving your position legally indefensible.

September 4th Text About Leaving Town (Partial Quotation)
Landlord’s Claim: “I have your Sept. 4th pm text… ‘leaving town… indefinitely’”

Law: Fla. Stat. §715.104 requires you to provide proper written notice and an opportunity for retrieval before treating property as abandoned.

Fact: You selectively quoted my text to imply I abandoned my property. The full text states: “Hi Luther, I’m leaving town tonight indefinitely. It’s the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property. I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank you.” In context, this message reaffirms my intent to retrieve my possessions, not abandon them. My documented efforts to reclaim items refute any claim of abandonment.

Conclusion: By quoting only part of my text to distort its meaning, you demonstrate bad faith and further undermine your credibility. A lawful abandonment determination requires statutory notice and a reasonable retrieval period, none of which you provided. Misrepresenting my communications does not erase your statutory failures; it only reinforces them.

Phone Records & No Calls Argument
Landlord’s Claim: “I have phone records that show you never called me…”

Law: Florida’s landlord-tenant statutes do not demand phone calls as the method of communication for deposit disputes or personal property retrieval. Written documentation is the legally preferred standard of evidence.

Fact: I relied on written requests—emails, letters, texts—creating a clear legal record. The law does not hinge upon phone calls. Your emphasis on calls that never occurred is a distraction from your failure to respond to the written communications that Florida law deems more definitive and enforceable.

Conclusion: The absence of phone calls is irrelevant. Legally, what matters is your response to my documented written requests, which you ignored. Since Florida statutes prioritize transparent, written notice and disclosure, your argument that I never called does nothing to justify your continued statutory noncompliance or withholding of my property.

Uncertainty About Personal Property & Alleged Delivery After Lease
Landlord’s Claim: “I cannot confirm or deny… I have not converted or sold any personal property…”

Law: Fla. Stat. §§715.10–715.111 outline the procedures you must follow before disposing of or converting tenant property, including giving proper notice and allowing a retrieval window.

Fact: Your inability to confirm property presence does not excuse failing to send the legally required notices. Advertising items like my grill as rental amenities strongly suggests you have retained and used my property for your benefit. You never provided any statutory notice of abandonment or followed the protocol for handling property as required by the statutes.

Conclusion: Uncertainty is no defense under Florida law. By ignoring the statutory process and benefiting from my property, you have effectively converted it. This wrongful conversion could expose you to treble damages and punitive damages in circuit court. Without strict compliance, your actions stand as unlawful appropriation of tenant-owned property.

Your 500 Property Counteroffer
Landlord’s Claim: “I propose… 500 for personal property… no further litigation.”

Law: Fla. Stat. §83.49 and related statutes uphold the tenant’s right to full deposit return absent properly documented deductions. Similarly, Fla. Stat. §§715.10–715.111 support full tenant rights over personal property unless the landlord follows legal disposal procedures.

Fact: My claims total 4,500 security deposit and $4,210.62 in personal property value. Your minimal offer fails to acknowledge your statutory noncompliance and the fact that no legitimate evidence supports withholding or converting my property. Courts have historically penalized landlords who fail to meet these evidentiary and procedural requirements, potentially awarding treble, punitive, and emotional distress damages.

Conclusion: Your offer is legally insufficient and financially insulting given the documented statutory violations. No partial measures or meager settlements will be entertained. You have forfeited informal remedy opportunities by refusing to comply with Florida law. The only acceptable path to avoiding litigation and severe legal consequences is immediate payment of the full $8,710.62.

Willingness to Talk or Mediate
Landlord’s Claim: “We need to talk… I am willing to attend mediation or other expedited dispute resolution.”

Law: Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 715.104 do not require me to engage in verbal negotiations after you have failed to meet statutory deadlines and documentary requirements. Mediation is an option, but it does not excuse prior noncompliance.

Fact: I have relied on written communications, as Florida law heavily favors clear, documented channels to establish a transparent record of compliance or noncompliance. You ignored these, missing your statutory windows, and now offer mediation only after the fact. Without adherence to legal obligations at the appropriate times, talk of mediation is too little, too late.

Conclusion: Your sudden openness to mediated discussions cannot reverse your missed deadlines or rectify the absence of legally required disclosures. Any hope of informal resolution has passed. Now, only immediate, full payment of $8,710.62 can avert circuit court proceedings, where you face treble damages, punitive damages, and other severe legal and financial repercussions.


• The lease explicitly identifies Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk as landlords, omitting Amarlu Enterprises or any associated assumed business names (Amarlu Enterprises, Amarlu Company, Amarlu Consulting).

Payment Instructions:
• Tenants were provided with ten (10) pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes at move-in, directing payments to Amarlu Enterprises at 231 Government Ave 3094, Hickory, NC 28602.

• Despite Amarlu Enterprises collecting rent, it was not disclosed in the lease agreement nor registered to conduct business in Florida.

Amarlu Enterprises and Assumed Business Names:
• Amarlu Enterprises is a North Carolina-registered entity, with assumed business names of Amarlu Enterprises, Amarlu Company, and Amarlu Consulting, filed on July 7, 2023 with the Catawba County Register of Deeds.

• Furthermore, and with critical influence on the outcome of this dispute, Amarlu Enterprises, a North Carolina entity owned by Luther Rollins and Mary O. Polk, is not registered as a foreign entity with the Florida Division of Corporations, violating Florida Statutes § 605.0902. However, this entity is collecting revenue illegally and in the shadows within the State of Florida via rental income.

Evidence Supporting the Tenant’s Case:
• Proof of payments instructed to be made directly to Amarlu Enterprises.

• The lease agreement omits Amarlu Enterprises entirely.

• Instructions to tenants to use pre-stamped envelopes addressed to Amarlu Enterprises.

• Personal property worth $4,200 was withheld by the landlords without legal justification.

• The landlords made a counteroffer of only 1,500 for the security deposit, failing to address the broader legal issues.

Landlord’s Professional Background:
• Luther Rollins is a licensed attorney in good standing with the North Carolina State Bar and holds his license officially with the ** Missouri Bar**, practicing in North Carolina as an out-of-state member. His legal expertise heightens the expectation of compliance with state laws and ethical obligations. This is most critical as it relates to punitive claims against the landlord.

Legal Issues Identified

Failure to Register as a Foreign Entity:
• Florida law requires out-of-state entities like Amarlu Enterprises to register before conducting business in the state.

• By collecting $45,000 in rent without registration, Amarlu Enterprises violated Florida Statutes § 605.0902. Under the law, this immediately renders the lease fully illegal, any dispute for security deposits defaults to the tenants' favor, property value to be restored in full, etc. Further, this could result in civil penalties.

Fraudulent Misrepresentation:
• The lease failed to disclose Amarlu Enterprises, yet tenants were instructed to make payments to this entity.

• Fraudulent misrepresentation arises from this intentional omission, as tenants were deprived of a full understanding of the parties involved in the agreement.

Violation of Florida Landlord-Tenant Laws:
• Florida Statutes § 83.49 requires landlords to return security deposits within 30 days of lease termination or provide an itemized list of deductions if retaining any portion of the security deposit, thus placing a claim on the deposit. Failure to comply can result in the forfeiture of the deposit and statutory penalties. The landlord met this timely obligation by issuing a certified letter on the 30th and final day of the 30-day window from the day the tenant vacated the property.

• Withholding personal property valued at $4,200 violates Florida Statutes § 83.67, which prohibits landlords from unlawfully retaining or disposing of tenants' property.

Ethical and Professional Misconduct:
• As a licensed attorney, Luther Rollins is held to higher ethical standards. His involvement in structuring the lease and payment arrangements in violation of Florida law raises questions about professional misconduct under North Carolina and Missouri bar rules.

Tax Evasion:
• Payments directed to Amarlu Enterprises, an unregistered entity, raise concerns about compliance with Florida and federal tax laws. The lack of registration suggests an attempt to avoid Florida’s tax obligations.

Payment Instructions:
• Upon move-in, tenants were provided with pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes directing all rent payments to Amarlu Enterprises at 231 Government Ave 3094, Hickory, NC 28602.

• Every payment for the full lease term (totaling $45,000) was made to Amarlu Enterprises, despite its omission from the lease agreement.

• This discrepancy between the lease agreement and payment practices forms the basis for allegations of fraud and misrepresentation.

Amarlu Enterprises and Assumed Business Names:
• On July 7, 2023, Rollins and Polk filed documentation with the Catawba County Register of Deeds, certifying that Amarlu Enterprises would operate under three assumed business names:

Amarlu Enterprises.

Amarlu Company.

Amarlu Consulting.

• However, none of these entities or assumed names are registered with the Florida Division of Corporations as required by Florida Statutes § 605.0902, which mandates foreign business registration before conducting business in Florida.

• The use of an unregistered foreign entity to collect rent in Florida constitutes a direct violation of state law.

Personal Property Withheld:
• Upon termination of the lease, the landlords withheld personal property belonging to the tenants, valued at $4,200 after depreciation.

• Florida Statutes § 83.67 prohibits landlords from unlawfully retaining or disposing of tenant property. The withholding of personal items constitutes another legal violation.

Landlords’ Counteroffer:
• In response to initial demands for the return of the withheld property and a portion of the security deposit, the landlords offered:

• $500 for the personal property (far below its depreciated value).

• 4,500 security deposit.

• This counteroffer fails to address the broader legal violations, including fraudulent collection of rent and failure to register Amarlu Enterprises in Florida.

Landlord’s Legal Background:
• Luther Rollins is a licensed attorney in good standing with the North Carolina State Bar and an out-of-state member of the Missouri Bar.

• His legal expertise increases his accountability for ensuring compliance with state laws and ethical practices. Using his professional knowledge to structure lease and payment arrangements that circumvent Florida law raises serious ethical concerns and potential bar violations.

Legal Issues Identified

Violation of Florida Business Registration Laws:
• Florida Statutes § 605.0902 requires foreign entities to register with the Florida Division of Corporations before conducting business in the state.

• Amarlu Enterprises collected rent for a Florida property without registering, making its actions illegal and potentially invalidating the lease agreement.

• Consequences of this violation:

• Amarlu Enterprises cannot enforce any legal claims in Florida courts until it registers as a foreign entity.

• Tenants may seek full restitution of rent payments made to an unregistered entity.

Fraudulent Misrepresentation:
• The landlords failed to disclose Amarlu Enterprises in the lease agreement while directing payments to the entity.

• This deliberate omission constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation, depriving tenants of the opportunity to understand the true parties involved in the lease.

• Fraudulent intent is further evidenced by:

• The use of pre-stamped envelopes addressed to Amarlu Enterprises.

• The landlords’ failure to comply with Florida’s business and tax laws.

Violation of Florida Landlord-Tenant Laws:
• Security Deposit Mishandling:

• Florida Statutes § 83.49 requires landlords to return security deposits within 15 days of lease termination or provide an itemized list of deductions.

• The landlords’ failure to meet these requirements entitles the tenant to the full deposit amount, plus potential penalties for bad faith.


83.50 - Disclosure of Landlord's Address - The LEASE states that the Landlord must list a "landlord address" and certain written permissions are required to be sent to the landlord in writing. The landlord did not list his address in Hickory, NC. Rather, the landlord listed the same address as the leased property in which the lease was being executed for. It could be stated that written permission for any claim such as altering the property was not possible due to the written permissions being executed per the lease and thus the written requests for permission would just end up in the same mailbox that attempted to mail requests to the landlord. this is another example of bad, improper, unethical, sneaky attention to detail.
The landlord address listed is the same address as the leased home address. More bad faith?
• Unlawful Retention of Property:

• Florida Statutes § 83.67 prohibits landlords from withholding or disposing of tenant property. The landlords’ actions in withholding $4,200 worth of personal property violate this statute.

Tax Evasion:
• By funneling rental income through an unregistered entity, the landlords may have failed to report income properly to Florida tax authorities.

• This raises potential tax evasion concerns at both the state and federal levels.

Ethical and Professional Misconduct:
• As a licensed attorney, Rollins is held to higher ethical standards under bar rules in North Carolina and Missouri.

• Structuring a fraudulent lease arrangement to avoid legal and tax obligations could result in disciplinary action from the respective bar associations.

Repetitive, Coercive Communications and Misrepresentation of Legal Requirements**

Your persistent attempts to coerce me into a phone call, despite my clear, written request for all communications to remain in writing, constitute a pattern of harassment—especially given your self-declared status as a “corporate attorney” and the intimidation factor introduced by your “luther2law” email address. Florida’s landlord-tenant statutes do not compel me to engage in phone discussions to resolve disputes or address your claims. Yet you continued to push for verbal contact, misrepresenting that the law requires such a step.

Timeline of Intensive Harassment on October 29, 2024:
Over the course of approximately six hours, you escalated your pressure tactics, placing repeated phone calls and leaving multiple voicemails, each attempt separated by roughly two-hour intervals. After ignoring my standing request for written correspondence, you made two phone calls followed by two voicemails, all within a short timeframe. When I did not respond, you followed up with a text message, again approximately two hours later, thereby punctuating the day with a relentless cycle of unsolicited outreach.

Quoted Text Message Written by Luther Rollins, Landlord:

After these repeated phone contacts and voicemails, you sent me the following text message on October 29, 2024:

“Hi Stephen, I called you a couple times today to discuss the Tenant Response & Dispute you sent to me which I recently received. I hope we could talk (and I believe we are both supposed to) try to resolve amicably. I am available most days this week 9:00am-ish till about 10pm.”

In this message, you again attempt to frame the resolution process as something that supposedly mandates a phone call, stating “I believe we are both supposed to” engage in a verbal discussion. This is categorically untrue. Fla. Stat. §§83.49 and 83.51, which govern security deposits and habitability, as well as §§715.10–715.111, which outline procedures for handling personal property, impose no requirement for phone calls, verbal negotiations, or live discussions. Your claim that “we are both supposed to” have a phone call severely misrepresents the law and seeks to corner me into a scenario where I would be at a disadvantage—“outmatched by a declared lawyer”—contrary to the transparency and fairness that the statutes intend.

Impact and Legal Implications:
The repeated calls, voicemails, and now this text message—each separated by roughly two-hour intervals—display a calculated effort to erode my stance on written communication and push me into a verbally intimidating interaction. This calculated timing and insistence on a method never required by statute is a form of harassment. Your decision to leverage your attorney status, along with an email moniker implying legal expertise, only intensifies the coercive atmosphere.

Conclusion:
These actions—excessive calling, repeated voicemails, and sending a misleading text message after a series of two-hour interval attempts—violate the principle of written, verifiable communication that Florida law heavily favors and I explicitly requested. By misrepresenting legal requirements and attempting to pressure me into a “phone call” that statutes do not mandate, you have crossed into harassment and bad-faith intimidation. This coercive behavior will not force me to abandon my legal rights or documented communication channels. Instead, it further solidifies my resolve to seek remedies permitted by Florida law, should you continue to flout statutory directives and proper dispute resolution procedures.
