This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for submitting Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, requests to various federal and state agencies. The goal is to investigate potential business irregularities, deceptive filings, and fraud associated with AMARLU enterprises, AMARLU consulting, and AMARLU company, and their founders, Luther J. Rollins Jr. and Mary O. Polk. The focus will be on uncovering information not easily found through standard public records searches, especially regarding official complaints, investigations, and enforcement actions.
Understanding FOIA and Public Records Laws
It's important to know the difference between general public records and information available through FOIA. Public records laws, such as North Carolina's Public Records Law, generally provide access to documents created or received by government agencies during public business, unless there's a specific exemption. FOIA at the federal level, and similar state-level laws, offer a way to request records that might not be regularly published or easily accessible.
The key principle is that FOIA requests target records held by government agencies that shed light on their actions, investigations, or interactions with the entities or individuals in question. They are generally not a way to get private financial records, like personal tax returns, of third parties, which are protected by strict privacy laws. However, records about investigations into tax fraud or non-compliance might be accessible.
Information Gaps and FOIA Targets
Based on an initial review of documents and research into North Carolina business registration and public records laws, the following types of information are generally not available through routine county or state public records but are potential targets for FOIA requests:
 * Internal Communications and Investigations: This includes memos, emails, internal reports, and investigative files related to complaints or inquiries about AMARLU entities or the founders from state or county agencies. It also covers communications between agencies about their activities.
 * Detailed Financial Information from Agency Records: While direct tax returns are confidential, records about tax investigations, audits, or enforcement actions by state, such as the North Carolina Department of Revenue, and federal, such as the IRS, tax authorities concerning AMARLU entities or the founders might be available.
 * Specific Details of Ongoing Investigations: This includes detailed evidence, witness statements, and investigative strategies from active investigations into alleged irregularities, violations, or fraud.
 * Specific Communications with Regulatory Bodies: Correspondence, phone logs, and meeting minutes between AMARLU or its founders and regulatory bodies that are not part of a public filing.
 * Information from Out-of-State Agencies: Records from Florida state agencies regarding AMARLU Enterprises' operations in Florida, especially concerning its unregistered status and property management practices.
Strategic Approach to FOIA Requests
To make your FOIA requests as effective as possible, consider these strategic elements:
 * Focus on Agency Actions, Not Private Data: Frame your requests to seek records about the agency's interactions with or investigations into the entities or individuals, rather than directly seeking private information like personal tax returns.
 * Be Specific but Broad Enough: Clearly define the scope of your request, including specific names, business names, and timeframes, but avoid being so narrow that you miss relevant documents. Use keywords that agencies are likely to use in their internal records.
 * Request Communications: Always ask for internal communications such as emails, memos, and meeting notes related to the subject, as these can reveal internal discussions, concerns, or leads.
 * Request Complaint Records: Seek records of any complaints filed against the entities or individuals.
 * Request Investigative Records: Ask for records related to any investigations, audits, or enforcement actions.
 * Specify Timeframes: Always include a clear timeframe for the records you are seeking, for example, from January 1, 2020, to the present. This ensures you receive relevant and manageable results.
 * Anticipate Exemptions: Be aware that agencies might cite exemptions under FOIA, such as privacy, ongoing investigations, or trade secrets. You might receive redacted documents or denials. Be prepared to appeal denials if necessary.
 * No Statement of Purpose Required in North Carolina: In North Carolina, you generally do not need to state your purpose for requesting public records, which can be helpful for investigations.
Specific FOIA Requests and Target Offices
Here are the most useful and informative FOIA requests to submit, along with the relevant offices and why they are beneficial for an investigation into business irregularities, violations, deceptive statutory and business regulation filings, and fraud.
 * North Carolina Secretary of State, Corporations Division

Why These FOIA Requests Are Beneficial for an Investigation
These FOIA requests are designed to go beyond routine public records and access the internal workings and findings of government agencies concerning the alleged illicit activities of Luther Rollins Jr., Mary O. Polk, and their AMARLU entities. They are essential for building a strong case around business irregularities, violations, deceptive filings, and fraud by providing official documentation of complaints, investigations, and enforcement actions. Specifically:
 * Uncovering Official Scrutiny: If government agencies have received complaints or started investigations, these FOIA requests will reveal that. This indicates that the alleged irregularities are not just isolated incidents but have drawn official attention.
 * Identifying Patterns of Deception: By getting records from multiple agencies, such as the Secretary of State, Consumer Protection, Revenue, and potentially Florida agencies, you can create a comprehensive picture of how the individuals and their businesses have allegedly engaged in deceptive practices across different regulatory areas and jurisdictions.
 * Evidence of Non-Compliance: FOIA requests can yield documents detailing specific violations of business registration laws, consumer protection statutes, or tax regulations. This provides concrete evidence for any legal action or further investigation.
 * Revealing Financial Irregularities: While direct tax returns are protected, records of tax investigations or audits by the NCDOR or IRS could indicate that the reported revenue or financial activities of AMARLU entities and the founders are under scrutiny, suggesting potential tax fraud or evasion.
 * Supporting Legal Action: Information obtained through FOIA can serve as crucial evidence in civil litigation or can be used to inform law enforcement agencies for potential criminal investigations. It provides an official paper trail that might otherwise be inaccessible.
 * Understanding Agency Knowledge: Even if an agency hasn't taken formal action, internal communications or inquiries revealed through FOIA can show that the agency was aware of potential issues, which can be valuable for understanding the regulatory landscape and potential future actions.
 * Breadcrumbs for Further Investigation: The information obtained from these FOIA requests can provide leads for additional research, interviews, or other investigative steps. For example, if a complaint mentions specific individuals or incidents, those can be followed up on.
This comprehensive approach ensures that all potential avenues for official documentation of irregularities are explored, providing a strong foundation for any further investigation or legal action.

Investigation of AMARLU Enterprises, Consulting, and Company Filings in North Carolina

Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive investigation into AMARLU Enterprises, AMARLU Consulting, and AMARLU Company, focusing on their business filings in Catawba County and the State of North Carolina. These names were registered as assumed business names in 2023 by founders Luther J. Rollins Jr. and Mary O. Polk, and the goal here is to identify any irregular, deceptive, or misleading aspects of those filings. The findings draw on publicly available records – such as assumed name certificates and state databases – and highlight potential misrepresentations (e.g. false addresses, missing registrations) that could indicate purposeful evasion of legal requirements for financial gain. Where information is not publicly accessible, we outline recommended FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) or public-records requests to obtain further details. All key findings are organized under clear headings with supporting citations.

Business Filings Overview in North Carolina

Assumed Name Registrations: 



On July 7, 2023: Luther J. Rollins Jr. and Mary O. Polk filed an Assumed Business Name Certificate with the Catawba County Register of Deeds, registering the names “AMARLU Enterprises,” “AMARLU Company,” and “AMARLU Consulting” for their business use. 

This single certificate listed all three names (North Carolina law allows up to five on one filing) and was officially recorded in book 3819, pages 559-560 . The registration indicates the business nature as “real estate rental” and “consulting”, with the owners of the business being Luther J. Rollins, Jr. and Mary O. Polk.

July 14, 2023: The assumed name record was indexed in the state’s online database. Notably, the certificate was filed for “All NC Counties,” meaning the registrants declared an intent to use these names statewide .

No Corporate Entity in NC: 

Aside from the assumed name (DBA) filing, there is no evidence of any formal corporation, LLC, or other registered legal entity in North Carolina named “Amarlu Enterprises,” “Amarlu Company,” or “Amarlu Consulting.” A search of the NC Secretary of State’s business registry returns only the assumed name records above and no separate business entity (LLC/Inc) for “Amarlu”  . In the assumed name certificate, the “real name” of the business owner is given as the two individuals (Rollins and Polk) rather than an existing company, confirming that the business operates as an unincorporated sole proprietorship or partnership, not as an LLC or corporation . Consequently, there are no annual reports or corporate filings on record for an “Amarlu” company in NC – annual reports are only required of incorporated entities, and none exists in this case. The absence of a registered LLC/corporation means the venture isn’t subject to the routine transparency and compliance checks (e.g. registered agent, annual reporting) that a formal entity would be. This reliance on an assumed name only, while legal in itself, is noteworthy because it may limit the public information available about the business’s operations and could be intended to minimize regulatory oversight.

Business Dissolution or Amendments: Since no NC corporation was ever formed for Amarlu, there are no corporate dissolution records to examine. Regarding the assumed name registration, as of mid-2025 there is no public record of any withdrawal or amendment to the original assumed name certificate – it remains active under the initial filing. North Carolina’s Assumed Business Name Act requires an amendment filing within 60 days if any information in the original certificate changes (such as the business address or ownership) . As discussed below, there have been changes in how the business’s address was represented after the initial filing, yet no amendment appears to have been filed, which itself may constitute non-compliance with N.C.G.S. §66-71.7.

Address Irregularities and Misrepresentation

One of the most striking irregularities is the business address provided in official filings, which appears to be deliberately misleading:
	•	Address on the Filed Certificate: The assumed name certificate lists the “street address of the principal place of business” as “231 Government Ave. SW #3097, Hickory, NC 28603-3097.” . Importantly, the NC filing form explicitly states “(Post office boxes are not acceptable)” for the principal business address , yet the address given – 231 Government Ave SW #3097 – is not a true street location for the business. This address corresponds to the Hickory Main Post Office building at 231 Government Ave SW . The “#3097” is not an office suite in that building but a USPS post office box number, with “28603-3097” being the ZIP code and mail routing code for that PO Box. In other words, the founders listed a P.O. Box disguised as a physical office address, apparently to satisfy the form’s requirement while concealing that it’s actually a mailbox.
	•	Evidence of Misrepresentation: Multiple pieces of evidence confirm that 231 Government Ave SW #3097 is not a legitimate physical business office:
	•	The building at 231 Government Ave SW is a U.S. Postal Service facility, not a commercial office complex . The USPS itself lists that address for the Hickory post office (with an internal designation “Ste 99” for the postal lobby) and uses ZIP code 28602 for street deliveries . In contrast, ZIP code 28603 is reserved for mail going to PO boxes in Hickory . The use of 28603 in the filing address effectively directs mail to the post office’s internal mailboxes, revealing that #3097 is a P.O. box rather than a suite.
	•	According to an investigative report on this address, suite “#3097” does not exist as a rentable office space in the building. Realtors familiar with the property confirmed that while there are a few small offices (for example, the FBI has a suite 303 in that federal building) , there is no suite numbered 3097. The number corresponds only to a postal box assignment, indicating a fabricated suite designation.
	•	The registrants initially presented the address with the street and “#3097” format, but in later correspondence they progressively shifted to using “P.O. Box 3097” without the street line, ultimately revealing the address’s true nature . This evolution – from a full street address (implying a physical location) to eventually just a P.O. Box – underscores that the original filing was masking a mailbox as a business office. In short, the business never had a bona fide bricks-and-mortar office at that location, despite the implication in the filed certificate.

The use of a P.O. Box as the sole contact address can violate various requirements:
	•	State Filing Violation: By providing a P.O. Box in the guise of a street address, the filing violates the spirit and letter of N.C.G.S §66-71.5, which mandates a real street address for the principal place of business on an assumed name certificate  . The form’s “no P.O. box” rule exists so that the public has a way to locate or serve the business at a physical location. In this case, that purpose is defeated – anyone attempting to visit “#3097 at 231 Government Ave SW” would only find a post office lobby. This kind of misrepresentation may be considered a false statement on a government filing. (Notably, the certificate is not known to be notarized under oath; however, it is signed by the owners, attesting to its accuracy.)
	•	Potential Federal/Postal Issues: The pattern of using the post office address as a fake suite could raise mail fraud or USPS policy concerns. The USPS does offer a service for P.O. box holders to use the street address of the post office for deliveries, but there are guidelines (e.g. one typically must still include “PO Box” or use a specific format). Here the landlords consistently omitted “PO Box” to present the address as a standard business suite . This intentional obscuring of the mailbox’s true nature might be seen as an attempt to lend undeserved legitimacy (making tenants or correspondents think Amarlu has a real office). In fact, the compiled evidence explicitly flags this as a “pattern of deliberate address misrepresentation” and even suggests it could fall under mail fraud if used to deceive others via mail . While only authorities can make that legal determination, it is clear the address was used deceptively.
	•	Address Inconsistencies Over Time: As mentioned, the way the address was used in practice changed over time:
	•	In the July 2023 filing, it appears as a street address with suite #3097 .
	•	On at least one certified letter’s return address soon after, the same format was used (suggesting the landlords initially represented their address that way in correspondence) .
	•	In subsequent correspondence, the format changed to “231 Government Ave SW, PO Box 3097, Hickory, NC 28603” , explicitly adding “PO Box”.
	•	Finally, the most recent known address usage dropped the street entirely, using just “PO Box 3097, Hickory, NC 28603” .
This progression implies that once the business was established or communicating with certain parties, the owners were no longer concerned about hiding the P.O. box (or perhaps were advised to use the proper format for mail delivery). However, no amendment was filed with the Register of Deeds to reflect any “change” in principal address. If one considers the initial address and the later mailing address as effectively the same location (the post office), they might argue no change occurred. But the form of the address did change (from a pseudo-physical address to a clearly mailing address), and more importantly, it was never a valid physical location to begin with. Under N.C.G.S. §66-71.7, any change to information in the assumed name certificate should trigger an amendment filing within 60 days . The apparent failure to amend the filing to either provide a real physical address or at least transparently indicate the mailing address could be seen as a continued non-compliance.

In summary, the business address issue is a red flag suggesting purposeful concealment. By using a mailbox as the registered business address, the owners made it difficult for customers, creditors, or regulators to locate a functioning office. This could be interpreted as an attempt to avoid service of process or inspection, and it certainly deprives the public of accurate information, undermining the very purpose of assumed name registration (which, by law, is to let the public know who and where is behind a business name  ).

Compliance with NC Business Name Statutes

North Carolina’s Assumed Business Name Act (N.C.G.S. §§ 66-71.1 through 66-71.15) sets out the requirements for filings, and the case of Amarlu raises several compliance concerns:
	•	Filing Requirement (66-71.4): The owners did fulfill the basic requirement to file an assumed name certificate before engaging in business under that name . There is no indication they operated using “Amarlu Enterprises/Consulting/Company” prior to the July 7, 2023 filing. In that sense, they met the initial obligation by registering in Catawba County, which covers their activities in North Carolina.
	•	Content of Certificate (66-71.5): The law requires specific content on the certificate, including the assumed name, the real name of the business owner(s), the nature of business, and a street address for the principal place of business  . Let’s assess each:
	•	Assumed Name: They listed three assumed names (Amarlu Enterprises, Company, Consulting), which is allowed (up to 5) as long as the same party uses all names  . There’s no evidence of any other business using those names, so no conflict there.
	•	Real Owner Name: They correctly provided the names Luther J. Rollins, Jr. and Mary O. Polk as the persons engaging in business . Since they are individuals and not, say, an LLC, listing their own names is proper. (If they had been an LLC or corporation, they would have had to list that entity’s exact name and its NC SOS ID number , which they did not – further confirmation that no such entity existed.)
	•	Nature of Business: The certificate indicates “Real Estate Rental” and “Consulting” as the nature/type of business . Those descriptions seem plausible given the context (they were collecting rent from property and possibly offering some consulting services). There’s nothing obviously irregular in stating that – except that it paints a broad picture. (It’s worth noting that using multiple broad descriptors could be a way to keep activities vague, but it’s not illegal. It just gives flexibility to do various things under the assumed names.)
	•	Street Address: Here is the major compliance failure, as detailed in the previous section. Instead of a valid street address, a P.O. box location was given, circumventing the rule that “Post office boxes are not acceptable” on the form . This does not comply with §66-71.5(a)(4), which implicitly requires an actual physical address for the business . By providing an address that looked like a street address but was effectively a mailing address, the filing is arguably false or misleading on its face. This could potentially invalidate the filing or at least put the owners in violation of the statute’s requirements. (North Carolina law does not specify the penalty for a false address on an assumed name certificate, but since the purpose of the law is to give public notice, a willfully false filing might be considered a misdemeanor under general false filings statutes or could simply be corrected by order of a court if challenged. As of now, the record stands uncorrected.)
	•	County of Business: They checked “All NC Counties” on the form . This is allowable (the form explicitly permits listing all 100 counties if desired) and means the assumed names can legally be used anywhere in North Carolina. While not improper, this blanket coverage could be seen as unusual if the business was only ever conducted in one location. It suggests the owners wanted maximum flexibility or perhaps were unsure where the business might expand. It’s also possible they did this to avoid having to file separate or additional certificates if they moved operations to another county. In any case, it’s legally valid, but it means the assumed names are not limited to Catawba County – something to keep in mind if any business activity pops up elsewhere in NC.
	•	Prohibited Entity Designations: North Carolina law also forbids including certain entity suffixes in an assumed name if you’re not actually that type of entity – for example, you cannot put “Inc.” or “LLC” in your DBA name unless you have incorporated or formed an LLC  . The Amarlu names use none of those forbidden terms. Words like “Enterprises,” “Consulting,” or “Company” are generic and allowed. However, using “Company” in “Amarlu Company” could arguably mislead laypersons into thinking it is an incorporated company. The law does not explicitly ban the word “Company” in a DBA (since even partnerships can use “& Company” in a name), so this is not a statutory violation, but it does contribute to the overall impression that “Amarlu” is a formal business entity when it is not. In short, the owners stayed within the letter of the naming rules while still choosing names that lend an air of an established business.
	•	Changes and Amendments (66-71.7): State law requires that if any information in the assumed name certificate changes (e.g. address changes, addition or removal of an owner, cessation in some counties), the owner must file an Assumed Name Certificate of Amendment within 60 days of the change . In the case of Amarlu:
	•	The business address provided was never a valid physical address to begin with. The subsequent usage of a pure P.O. Box address could be construed as a change (at least in how the business is represented). If one interprets that the “principal place of business” effectively changed (from a purported street location to no street location), an amendment should have been filed. We found no record of any amendment filed in Catawba County for the Amarlu assumed names – the state’s database still shows only the original July 2023 filing   and no later filings. Thus, if a change occurred, they did not report it as required. It’s likely the owners did not consider the clarification of their mailing address as an official “change” to be reported, or they chose not to draw attention to the discrepancy by amending the record.
	•	The ownership of the business (Rollins Jr. and Polk) has not publicly changed. If, for instance, one of them dropped out or they added a new partner, that would require an amendment. We have no indication of any such change – all evidence points to the same two individuals throughout.
	•	Nature of business likely remained rental and related activities; no amendment needed unless they drastically shifted focus (and even then, many wouldn’t file an amendment just to fine-tune the description).
	•	Use in counties doesn’t expire or change unless they chose to withdraw in some counties, which they have not done (they chose “All counties” initially).

In summary, under North Carolina law the primary compliance issue is the violation of the address requirement on the assumed name filing. The owners filed the necessary paperwork but did so in a misleading way, and then failed to correct or update that information. This frustrates the purpose of the statute (public transparency of who/what/where is behind a business name) . The statute doesn’t provide a clear remedy to the public for false information beyond the ability to sue or demand correction, but the discrepancy is documented.

Lack of Annual Reports or Corporate Transparency

Because Amarlu Enterprises/Consulting/Company is not incorporated in North Carolina, it is not subject to the corporate reporting that normal companies must adhere to. This has a few implications:
	•	No Annual Reports: NC corporations and LLCs must file annual reports with the Secretary of State (providing current principal office address, officers, etc.). Here, no such reports exist since there is no LLC/Corp. The only public filing about the business’s existence and status is that one-time assumed name certificate. After July 2023, the owners have had no obligation to publicly update any information (other than the assumed name amendment requirement, which they did not fulfill). This means key details – such as whether the business is still active, whether the business address or contact changed, or who is managing it – are not readily available to the public. In essence, they achieved a public presence (a business name) with minimal ongoing disclosure.
	•	No Registered Agent or Office on Record: A corporation or LLC would be required to designate a North Carolina registered agent and office for legal service. In this case, there is no registered agent beyond the individuals themselves. Any lawsuit or official notice would have to find them personally. With the only given address being a P.O. Box, reaching the owners directly could be challenging. This lack of a formal contact point might be intentional to reduce accountability, or simply a consequence of operating as a sole proprietorship. Either way, it complicates enforcement of any legal actions against the business name “Amarlu,” since legally that name is just an alias for the individuals.
	•	No Public Financials: Naturally, as a non-incorporated business, there are no public financial statements or disclosures (like one might get for a public corporation or even an LLC’s annual report which sometimes lists managers). The finances of Amarlu are entirely opaque except to the owners themselves and possibly the IRS/NC Department of Revenue via their personal tax returns.

While running a business as an unregistered sole proprietorship is not illegal per se, the choice to remain unincorporated (despite using an official-sounding name like “Company” or “Enterprises”) can be viewed as a tactic. It avoids the fees and obligations of incorporation, but also denies the public and the state some visibility into the business. Taken together with the misleading address, this approach suggests a desire to avoid scrutiny. If the owners intended to run a straightforward, above-board enterprise, they could have formed an LLC (a relatively simple process in NC) and provided a valid office address for it. The fact that they did not, and instead relied on a bare-bones assumed name registration with a P.O. Box, may indicate an effort to minimize paper trails.

NC Tax Filings and Revenue Compliance (2023–2024)

Another aspect of this investigation is whether AMARLU Enterprises (or related names) complied with tax registration and filing requirements in North Carolina for 2023 and 2024. Key observations include:
	•	State Tax Registration: In North Carolina, certain types of business activities require registration with the Department of Revenue (DOR). For example, if a business has employees, it must register for withholding tax; if it sells taxable goods or services, it must obtain a sales and use tax ID; if it rents out lodging for short terms, it might need to collect occupancy tax, etc. In the case of Amarlu:
	•	The primary activity identified is rental of real estate (specifically, they own rental property in Florida – more on that later). Rental income from long-term residential leases is not subject to NC sales tax and wouldn’t require a sales tax account. Since the property is in Florida, no NC sales tax or occupancy tax applies at all (Florida has its own tax rules for rentals, but those would be handled there if at all).
	•	If they conducted any consulting for pay, and if that consulting occurred in or from North Carolina, they might be subject to collecting sales tax if it was a taxable service (most consulting services are not taxed in NC, unlike goods). There’s no indication of significant consulting operations aside from the name itself.
	•	If they had employees in North Carolina (for example, if they hired someone to help with property management or consulting), they should have registered for withholding and unemployment insurance. There is no public record of any such registration. Typically, new employers are listed in certain public databases or at least could be found via unemployment insurance filings, but a search did not reveal anything under the Amarlu name. This suggests they likely have no employees in NC. The business is essentially just the two principals.
	•	Income Tax Reporting: Luther Rollins and Mary Polk, as NC residents (Hickory, NC), presumably have to report all their income on personal state and federal tax returns. That would include rental income from the Florida property and any consulting revenue from Amarlu. Those tax filings are private and not accessible without their consent or a subpoena. No public information from NC DOR confirms whether they reported the income or paid due taxes – that information is confidential by law. We can only note that if they failed to report the income, it would be a tax violation; however, there’s no outward sign such as tax liens or judgments in NC to suggest non-payment as of this writing (a check of Catawba County records did not show state tax liens against them under the business or personal names).
	•	NC Department of Revenue Records: The NC DOR does not provide a public searchable database of who has business tax accounts by name. Usually, one needs specific identifiers to verify tax registrations (like an account ID or EIN). We did not find any public listing of Amarlu Enterprises in contexts like a sales tax permit holder list or a state vendor list. Given the nature of their activities, it’s plausible they never needed to register for any specific NC business tax. If they did consulting for profit in 2023-2024, they likely reported it as self-employment income on their personal returns (Schedule C) and would pay income tax (and possibly self-employment tax federally) on it. There’s no separate NC business income tax for sole props beyond the individual income tax.
	•	Privilege Licenses and Local Taxes: North Carolina used to have a privilege license tax for certain businesses, but most of that was repealed years ago (cities can still levy minimal taxes on certain trades). There’s no indication Hickory or Catawba County had any license requirement for simply owning rental property or doing consulting under a trade name. We found no local business license under the name. The Catawba County Register of Deeds filing fee of $26 (and a $15 e-filing fee) was paid for the assumed name , and that might be the only business-related payment to local government we can identify.

In short, publicly accessible data shows no glaring tax registration omissions in NC – but this is largely because the business form they chose doesn’t trigger many public filings. The real question is whether the income is being properly reported on the back end. That is something only an audit or further inquiry could reveal. Given the pattern of concealment elsewhere, one might suspect they could underreport rental income (for example, Florida has no income tax, so one might think they’d try not to declare it to NC either). However, that is speculative. What we can say is there is no public record of Amarlu Enterprises paying any business taxes or obtaining any tax licenses in NC for 2023 or 2024 – consistent with a small, informally run operation.

For a definitive check, one could request the NC Department of Revenue (via a public records request or other channels) to confirm if any Business Tax Registration exists for “Amarlu Enterprises” or the individuals for those years. Due to confidentiality rules, DOR may not disclose much, but they might be able to confirm the existence or absence of, say, a sales tax account or withholding account under that name. As of now, our research did not uncover any such registrations.

Federal and IRS Records

The investigation also considered whether there are any federal filings or identifiers related to Amarlu Enterprises, such as an Employer Identification Number (EIN) or nonprofit status, etc., that are publicly accessible. Key points:
	•	Employer Identification Number (EIN): It is common for even sole proprietors to obtain an EIN from the IRS for banking or payroll purposes. If Rollins/Polk obtained an EIN for “Amarlu Enterprises” or any of the other names, that would be a tax identifier used on forms like 1099s or W-9s. EIN issuance records, however, are not public. The IRS does not provide a searchable database of EIN to entity name for the general public. We did not find any instance of an EIN in databases like the SEC EDGAR (which sometimes lists EINs for companies, but Amarlu is not a corporation so it wouldn’t appear there). In short, if an EIN exists, we cannot confirm it without the owners’ disclosure or an IRS request. This is an area where a FOIA to the IRS might be attempted (for example, one can request the Business Master File record for a given name to see if an EIN is associated), but privacy laws (Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code) may prevent the IRS from releasing it to a third party. No EIN was found through public sources.
	•	Federal Tax-Exempt Status: We checked if “Amarlu” appears in any IRS Tax-Exempt Organization search or charity registries. It does not – which is expected, as they are operating as a for-profit venture. There are no 990 forms or nonprofit determination letters on record for any Amarlu entity. (For thoroughness, note that there was an unrelated Florida corporation named “AMARLU, Corp.” formed in 1998 that was administratively dissolved in 2000 . That entity, based in Miami and having nothing to do with Rollins/Polk, did have an EIN (FEI 65-0873517) on file . It’s long defunct and not connected to the NC operation aside from the coincidental name. We mention this only to clarify that any IRS or SunBiz records linked to that 1990s Florida company are not relevant to the current investigation.)
	•	Federal Contracts or Loans: We also did a cursory check for any signs of Amarlu Enterprises in federal contract databases or COVID-relief loan databases (PPP loans, etc.), which are public. Not surprisingly, nothing turned up – the business is small/private enough that it likely never sought federal contracts or pandemic loans under that name. Its principals might have individually, but there’s no record of “Amarlu” in those datasets.
	•	IRS Compliance: If income is being funneled through an informal business, the main IRS concern would be whether that income is declared on 1040 returns. As noted, that’s not visible publicly. However, an interesting angle is the use of a business name for receiving income. Tenants were instructed to make rent checks payable to “Amarlu Enterprises” (according to the context of the dispute). If so, the owners likely set up a bank account in the name “Amarlu Enterprises” (typically, banks will allow a DBA account if you show the assumed name certificate and EIN or SSN of the proprietor). Opening a business bank account usually requires an EIN or at least the owner’s SSN attached. If an EIN was obtained for banking, that’s a private detail, but any mismatch (like if they advertised themselves as a company but lacked an EIN) could raise issues with banking regulations (banks are supposed to verify businesses under KYC rules). We have no evidence of any banking irregularity aside from the unusual address which might have been presented to the bank as well.
	•	No 1099/Employment Filings Found: If they hired contractors or filed any 1099 forms under the Amarlu name, those aren’t publicly available, but sometimes large payments could appear in databases if a contractor made them public. We didn’t find anything like that. It’s likely the financial footprint of Amarlu is relatively small and kept within personal accounts.

In conclusion on the federal side, there are no public IRS or federal records that shed light on Amarlu’s operations. The absence of public info is consistent with a small, private enterprise. This lack of federal “paper trail” could be by design – by not creating a corporation or nonprofit, the owners avoided any federal registrations that would show up in public databases (other than basic tax filings which are private). It keeps their business largely invisible to the public eye at the federal level. The only federal angle that stands out is the misuse of a federal facility (the post office address) for a purpose arguably against USPS rules – but again, that’s not documented publicly, it’s inferred from the situation.

Out-of-State Operations: Florida Connection

Although the focus is North Carolina, the investigation uncovered that the business activities of Amarlu Enterprises extend to Florida, raising additional compliance issues in that jurisdiction. In fact, the primary income-generating activity appears to be rental of a residential property in Florida (with tenants in place). Key findings include:
	•	No Florida Registration: A search of the Florida Division of Corporations (Sunbiz) database confirms that “Amarlu Enterprises” is not registered in Florida – neither as a domestic entity nor as a foreign qualified entity, nor even as a Florida fictitious name. The user’s research notes and our verification align: there is no Sunbiz entry for Amarlu Enterprises or the other Amarlu names in the current records . Florida law has two relevant requirements:
	•	If Amarlu Enterprises were an actual LLC or corporation formed outside Florida, it would need to register as a foreign entity to conduct business in Florida under Florida Statutes §605.0902 (for LLCs) or §607.1501 (for corporations). They have not done so . In fact, since there is no parent LLC at all (the business is just a NC sole proprietorship), they can’t register as a foreign LLC – instead they should operate as individuals.
	•	If individuals (like Rollins/Polk) do business in Florida under a name other than their personal legal names, Florida’s Fictitious Name Act (Fla. Stat. §865.09) requires them to register that name with the state and advertise it in a local newspaper. They clearly have not registered “Amarlu Enterprises” in Florida, as a search of Florida’s fictitious name registry came up empty. There is also no record of any required newspaper advertisement for that name (those are usually published in the local county where the business is based – presumably Pinellas or whichever county the property is in). This means Amarlu Enterprises is operating in Florida unlawfully in terms of business name usage. Florida can impose penalties for failure to file a fictitious name, and it also prohibits unregistered businesses from maintaining lawsuits in Florida courts until they comply  . That latter point is crucial: if, for example, “Amarlu Enterprises” tried to sue a tenant or enforce a lease in Florida, a court could bar the action because the entity is not properly registered. In essence, by not registering, the landlords undermine their own legal standing.
	•	Rental Property in Personal Name: Public records (Florida property appraiser data) show the rental property in question is deeded under Luther J. Rollins, Jr.’s name personally, not under any company . This was deliberately done; the landlords did not transfer the property into an LLC or a property management company. They then leased it to tenants while branding themselves as “Amarlu Enterprises” in communications. The lease agreement, however, reportedly listed the landlords just as “Luther J. Rollins Jr. and Mary O. Polk” – it did not mention Amarlu Enterprises at all  . This disconnect appears very intentional:
	•	The lease omitted the business name to perhaps avoid the question of its legitimacy, whereas all payment instructions given verbally or in writing told tenants to pay Amarlu Enterprises  . In other words, the tenants were dealing with a business entity that was invisible in the contract, which is quite unusual and deceptive. Normally, if a landlord is doing business under a name, that name would appear on the lease or an addendum to clarify who the landlord is. Here it was completely left out.
	•	This strategy could be construed as fraudulent misrepresentation or at least a lack of transparency. Tenants had no way to know that “Amarlu Enterprises” was just an alias with no legal substance. If a dispute arose (as it seems it did), the tenants could be confused about who actually owns the property and who they’re truly dealing with.
	•	Mailing Rent to NC P.O. Box: The tenants were instructed to mail rent checks to the North Carolina P.O. Box (3097) in Hickory  . From Florida’s perspective, this means rental income is being collected out of state by an unregistered entity. This can have multiple implications:
	•	Jurisdiction and Enforcement: If tenants needed to take legal action (e.g., to recover a security deposit or sue for some reason), they might face hurdles – the payments went to a name and address not easily tied to a person in Florida jurisdiction. The landlords may have been attempting to keep Florida authorities at bay by doing everything through NC addresses.
	•	Tax Evasion Concerns: By routing the income to North Carolina and not registering in Florida, the owners might have been hoping to avoid certain Florida-specific taxes or scrutiny. For example, Florida has no state income tax, but it does have obligations like:
	•	Documentary Stamp Tax on leases: Florida requires payment of a doc stamp tax on rental agreements if rent is paid, usually handled by purchasing stamps. A savvy tenant or lawyer might ask if the landlords paid the required doc stamps on the lease. If not, that’s another oversight (though enforcement is spotty on that unless the lease gets recorded or goes to court).
	•	Tourist Development Tax: If this were a short-term rental, there would be county resort taxes due. (It appears to be a standard long-term lease, so that might not apply.)
	•	Federal tax reporting: If the income never touches Florida banks and is deposited in NC, perhaps the owners thought it would be less visible to Florida’s Department of Revenue (for sales tax or other business taxes). However, since Florida doesn’t tax personal income, the main evasion would be of the registration and any minor business taxes, rather than income tax.
	•	The research notes explicitly state that “diverting rental income through an unregistered foreign entity raises concerns about possible tax avoidance or evasion”, and that if the landlords are obscuring income flow to circumvent obligations, they risk penalties or even criminal charges . While Florida doesn’t tax the rent directly via income tax, failing to register the business and pay any due business-related taxes (or to report income properly to NC) could eventually draw regulatory attention.
	•	Conflict of Interest and Representation: Another minor note from the Florida side – the involvement of a Florida realtor, Mr. Zachary “Zach” Steinberger, is mentioned . He was working with Luther Rollins on future deals and also gave input on tenant issues despite not being a neutral party. While not directly related to filings, it underscores the somewhat under-the-table approach the landlords took. They relied on informal arrangements and advice (from a realtor friend) rather than engaging proper legal channels, which again speaks to an avoidance of formality that might characterize how they handle business filings as well.

In summary, the Florida aspect reveals a pattern of non-compliance consistent with what we see in North Carolina:
	•	The landlords operated under the radar, without registering their business name in Florida.
	•	They kept the property in a personal name (avoiding corporate ownership or any public business entity in FL).
	•	Communications with tenants were handled in a way that concealed the business and channeled funds out-of-state.
	•	These choices expose them to legal risks: for example, they likely cannot pursue claims in Florida courts as “Amarlu Enterprises” since it’s not a legal entity there , and tenants or authorities could challenge their non-compliance if it came to light. Already, one could argue the lease is void or unenforceable due to these legal defects (an argument the tenants have indeed raised, according to the notes)  .

For the purpose of this investigation, the Florida findings reinforce the conclusion that the founders have consistently avoided official registration and have provided misleading information to parties involved, across state lines. This tends to confirm that the irregularities in North Carolina (like the false address and lack of corporate status) are not accidental oversight but part of a deliberate modus operandi to minimize transparency and accountability.

Indicators of Purposeful Misrepresentation for Financial Gain

Bringing the pieces together, there are several red flags suggesting that Luther J. Rollins Jr. and Mary O. Polk intentionally structured and presented their business in a deceptive manner, likely to gain financial or legal advantages:
	•	Fabricated Physical Presence: The use of a phony office address (a postal box masquerading as a suite) on official records is a clear indicator of deception  . This was not a one-time typo or mistake; it appears to be a calculated attempt to satisfy a requirement without actually providing a real location. The benefit to the owners is that it becomes harder for clients, tenants, or process servers to find them. It also gives the illusion that “Amarlu Enterprises” might have a real office in North Carolina, perhaps lending unwarranted credibility. In terms of financial gain, this tactic could be used to attract tenants or partners under false pretenses (making the operation seem more established than it is), and to avoid liabilities (if someone tries to sue the business name at that address, they’d hit a dead end at a P.O. Box).
	•	Lack of Legal Entity = Less Oversight: By not forming an LLC or corporation, the owners avoided putting any information into the public record beyond the minimal assumed name certificate. This means no publicly listed registered agent, no annual disclosures of management, and no easy way to link the business to the individuals except through the assumed name filing. If a casual observer in 2024 tried to check “Amarlu Enterprises” in NC, they might find the assumed name listing but see just the names and a dubious address. Many people might not even find that, since assumed name searches are less frequently done than LLC searches. The owners thus operated in a kind of gray zone – using a business name to appear professional, but not registering an entity that would subject them to ongoing regulation. The financial motive here could be to save money (no fees or franchise taxes for an LLC, no cost of a registered agent or professional filings), and also to potentially blur the lines for tax purposes. Income from a disregarded sole proprietorship might be easier to under-report than income to a formal business that has separate bank accounts and potentially more scrutiny. We do not have proof of under-reporting, but the structure itself – a lack of structure, in fact – facilitates it.
	•	Multi-Jurisdiction Evasion: The pattern of not registering in Florida while doing business and not providing a reachable address in North Carolina suggests purposeful evasion of legal requirements in both jurisdictions. Each step – skipping Florida’s fictitious name registration, skipping a true NC business address – has the effect of reducing the landlords’ visibility to government oversight. This multi-state evasion is typically seen in schemes where individuals try to avoid taxes or liabilities by operating out of state or under the radar. For example, by collecting rent in NC from FL property, they might hope that Florida authorities won’t notice an unregistered landlord (since everything is being handled via NC). Meanwhile, North Carolina authorities might not pay attention because the income is from property elsewhere (and the assumed name is filed so on paper it looks compliant). In the overlap, they create confusion that could allow income or activities to slip through cracks. This is a known tactic in fraud: arbitrage between jurisdictions’ enforcement.
	•	Misleading Tenants and Counterparties: From the tenant’s perspective (or any client dealing with “Amarlu”), the landlords’ practices were deceptive and potentially fraudulent:
	•	The tenants were never formally told that their landlord was a business entity (the lease listed individuals), yet they were asked to pay a business name. This disconnect can be seen as a constructive fraud – an intentional omission of material fact (that Amarlu Enterprises is just the landlords under another name) which, had the tenants known, might have affected their decisions. It certainly put the tenants at a disadvantage in understanding who is accountable.
	•	The tenants lacked a physical address to reach the landlords (only a P.O. Box). North Carolina law (and likewise Florida law) often require landlords to disclose an address for official communications. Providing only a P.O. Box might violate landlord-tenant laws that require an address for service of notices. This is another angle of non-compliance.
	•	By concealing Amarlu’s role in the lease, the owners could later claim (if convenient) that the lease was with them personally and Amarlu was just a “branding.” Or vice versa, they could use the presence of the DBA on checks to argue some separation if it benefited them legally. This kind of flip-flopping is a hallmark of bad-faith actors – they exploit the ambiguity of their setup to avoid responsibilities. For instance, if sued for something as individuals, they might say “oh, that was the business’s matter” to confuse proceedings (even though the business isn’t a legal entity). Conversely, if it was beneficial to hide behind the business name (to, say, avoid personal liability), they would use it, even though legally it doesn’t shield them. This is purposeful obfuscation.
	•	Financial Motivation – Taxes and Liability: The ultimate motive behind these misrepresentations seems to be financial protection:
	•	Tax Minimization: As noted, routing income through an unregistered name and across state lines raises the suspicion that the owners may be trying to avoid tax triggers. The research notes explicitly raise the possibility of tax evasion – for example, if they did not report the Florida rental income to NC, they would illegally avoid NC state income tax on that money . Also, not having a business formally could help them argue certain deductions or loopholes (or simply keep transactions off the books).
	•	Avoiding Regulatory Fees: By not registering in Florida, they saved the costs of a foreign LLC registration or a Florida fictitious name filing and publication. These are not huge fees, but the pattern suggests they were unwilling to engage in even nominal compliance costs, preferring to keep everything informal. This frugality might hint that they didn’t want to leave any trail or spend money on compliance that doesn’t directly profit them.
	•	Liability Shielding (or lack thereof): Ironically, by not forming an LLC, they did not shield themselves from liability – but perhaps they believed that using a business name and a distant address would serve a similar purpose informally. In other words, they might have assumed that if something went wrong, it would be hard for a tenant or creditor to actually pursue them personally because everything was in an alias and out-of-state. This is a risky and potentially naive strategy, but it might have been their thinking. It’s also possible they incorrectly believed that filing a DBA gave them some sort of separate business status (some laypeople misunderstand this). Regardless, the effect is that they have made it harder for others to hold them accountable, which can help them wrongfully retain funds (e.g., not returning a security deposit, as seems to be a dispute here) without easy recourse for the other party.
	•	Pattern of Non-Compliance: None of these actions – false address, no entity, no Florida filing – taken alone is conclusive proof of malicious intent. But taken together, they paint a consistent picture of non-compliance on multiple fronts. The landlords have sidestepped or violated every formal requirement that would normally apply to someone in their position:
	•	When NC said “give a real address,” they gave a fake one .
	•	When Florida said “register your business name,” they ignored it .
	•	When basic business prudence said “maybe form an LLC,” they declined.
	•	When transparency would dictate informing tenants who they’re paying, they kept that hidden .
This pattern is likely purposeful, not accidental. It suggests a strategy to operate in the shadows of the law to maximize personal gain (rent and any other income) while minimizing obligations and exposure.

In conclusion, the evidence strongly indicates that Rollins and Polk engaged in deliberate misrepresentation in their business filings and operations. The potential indicators of fraud or willful noncompliance identified include: the fake suite address (possibly to mislead creditors or authorities) , the failure to update or correct public records, the operation of an effectively unregistered business across state lines, and the concealment of the business’s role in transactions. These actions could merit investigation by regulatory authorities. For instance, the NC Secretary of State could look into whether the false address violates any filing fraud statutes, and the US Postal Service might review whether the use of their facility’s address in this manner violates postal regulations (since the USPS generally forbids using a PO Box address to deceive others). Additionally, the Florida Department of State and Department of Revenue would be interested to know an unregistered business is collecting rent in their state, and the IRS might take note if income was unreported.

Below, we outline what information is publicly accessible that led to these findings, versus what information would likely require formal requests or further investigation to obtain.

Publicly Accessible Findings vs. Restricted Information

Through this research, we were able to uncover a significant amount of information using public sources. However, some details remain inaccessible without targeted requests. Here we clarify which findings were from public records and which areas are not publicly available (thus potentially requiring FOIA or other inquiries):

Publicly Accessible Information:
	•	Assumed Business Name Certificate: The primary document (filed in Catawba County on 7/7/2023) was obtained from the county Register of Deeds. It is a public record, showing the three Amarlu assumed names, the owners’ names, the business nature, and the (questionable) address  . This record is indexed and searchable via the North Carolina Assumed Business Name database as well  . Anyone can request a copy of this filing from Catawba County or view the state’s online summary. It provided the basis for identifying the misleading address and the lack of any incorporated entity (since the owners listed are individuals).
	•	North Carolina Business Registry Search: We performed searches in the NC Secretary of State’s online system for any corporations or LLCs named “Amarlu” and found none. This search is public (no login required). The only relevant hits were the assumed name entries . This confirms that publicly, Amarlu exists only as a DBA, not a legally distinct company in NC.
	•	North Carolina General Statutes: The requirements and prohibitions (e.g. no P.O. box addresses, no unauthorized use of “Inc/LLC”, amendment rules) are all in the statutes and accessible online  . We cited these to measure compliance. These laws are public and help demonstrate where the filings deviated from what is required.
	•	Property and Address Verification: Using online tools and databases, we confirmed that 231 Government Ave SW, Hickory is the main post office (a federal building) and not a commercial rental space . Information from USPS (hours, services at that address) and even a commercial real estate listing for that building show its nature. We also noted legitimate suites like the FBI office (Suite 303) to contrast with the fake Suite 3097 . All of this address information is publicly available (USPS website, MapQuest/Yelp, etc.). Additionally, zip code directories clearly indicate 28603 is a P.O. Box-only ZIP Code in Hickory . These public sources collectively validate our conclusion about the address misrepresentation.
	•	Florida Sunbiz Search: The Florida Department of State’s corporation and fictitious name search is public (Sunbiz.org). We searched for “Amarlu” and confirmed no active registrations, corroborating the statement that Amarlu Enterprises is not registered in Florida . The only “Amarlu” was the unrelated dissolved corp from 1998, which is listed as inactive . This public search result supports the finding that the business is unregistered in Florida currently.
	•	Florida Property Records: Property ownership records in Florida are public at the county level. While we did not include a specific cited deed here, the user-provided text confirms the property was titled in Luther Rollins’s name . One could publicly verify this via the county property appraiser or clerk of court records. For instance, entering Rollins’s name in the Pinellas (or relevant county) property search would show the deed. This is relevant as it shows no company or trust owns the property – just the individual, matching the pattern of avoiding formal business structures.
	•	Florida Lease/Omission of Business: The content of the lease and how payments were instructed were described in the user’s documentation (likely derived from the actual lease and tenant communications). While the lease itself is private, the tenant (user) has provided these details, making them part of our “accessible” information set. We treated the user-supplied text as factual input. It revealed the non-disclosure of Amarlu in the lease and the direction to pay the PO Box, which are critical facts. Normally, one might not know these without seeing the lease, but since it’s provided in summary, we can use it. (We cite the analysis rather than the lease directly, as we presume it’s accurate.)  
	•	Statutes and Case Law (Florida): Publicly, one can also check Florida statutes about fictitious names and foreign entities. The user text references Fla. Stat. 605.0902 regarding foreign LLCs  and the general principle that an unregistered entity can’t sue. Those laws are published and confirm the legal risks they face. We used these public laws to interpret the situation, even if we didn’t directly cite Florida statute text here.
	•	Professional Directories: As an aside, verifying the individuals’ identities (e.g., Mary O. Polk is a medical doctor in Hickory , Luther J. Rollins Jr. is an attorney by background ) was done via public directories. This establishes them as educated professionals who likely understand what they are doing with these filings. While not directly needed for the business filing analysis, it gives context that these are not novices – which in turn suggests the missteps are willful, not ignorant. These personal details are public (e.g., Mary Polk’s medical license info, Luther Rollins’s bar registration or LinkedIn) and help support the notion of intent (though we tread carefully here, focusing on actions rather than character).

In summary, all the irregularities noted (false address, lack of NC entity, lack of FL registration, etc.) were identified using public records and sources. The puzzle was assembled by correlating those public facts. Anyone with the time and know-how could obtain these same records.

Information Likely Requiring FOIA or Special Requests:

Despite the extensive public findings, certain questions remain unanswered or unverified because the information is not openly available. To dig deeper into potential misconduct, the following items would require FOIA requests, public records requests, or other non-standard retrieval methods:
	•	Internal Correspondence or Warnings (NC Authorities): It’s unknown whether any North Carolina authority has noticed the issues with Amarlu’s filings. For example, the Secretary of State’s office or the Catawba County Register of Deeds might have internal notes or communications regarding the improper address on the assumed name certificate. It’s possible no one flagged it (such filings might be recorded as-is without verification), but if a Register of Deeds clerk corresponded with the filers about the address, or if the NC Secretary of State (which maintains the statewide assumed name database) had questions, those communications would not be public unless requested. A public records request to Catawba County could be made for “any correspondence, emails, or notes regarding the assumed business name filing for Amarlu Enterprises/Company/Consulting, particularly any regarding the address or compliance with filing requirements.” Similarly, a request to the NC Secretary of State’s Business Registration Division for any complaints or inquiries related to those assumed names or the owners might reveal if someone (for instance, a tenant or a government worker) filed a complaint about the false address or the business practices. If such complaints exist, they’d be immensely useful. These would require a targeted request, as they are not published anywhere. (North Carolina’s public records law is broad, so communications to a government office about a business can be requested, subject to some exemptions.)
	•	Confirmation of Tax Filings (NC Department of Revenue): As discussed, we can’t see their tax returns. However, one might attempt a request to NC Department of Revenue for any business tax registrations or licenses under the names “Amarlu Enterprises,” “Amarlu Consulting,” or “Amarlu Company,” or under the owners’ names at the Hickory address. While detailed tax info (like returns or amounts) is confidential and exempt from public disclosure, a yes/no confirmation of whether they have ever registered a business tax account might be obtainable. For instance, the DOR might confirm if a sales tax or withholding account exists (this is sometimes done to verify if a business is licensed to collect tax). If DOR cannot legally divulge that, another approach is to ask if any notices of non-filing were issued. The DOR occasionally issues assessments or liens for businesses that fail to file certain reports – those liens are public if they occur. We found no liens, but a FOIA could ask for “any final assessments or collection actions taken against Luther J. Rollins Jr. or Mary O. Polk dba Amarlu Enterprises” for the relevant years. If they truly didn’t owe such taxes, there will be nothing. If they did owe something like withholding and never filed, DOR might have initiated a case, which would then produce records.
	•	IRS Records and EIN Information: To know if an EIN was ever obtained for Amarlu and how it was presented, one could file a FOIA request with the Internal Revenue Service for the Form SS-4 (EIN application) corresponding to “Amarlu Enterprises” or related names. The IRS has a FOIA process that sometimes provides EIN confirmation letters or applications, especially if the requester can demonstrate a legitimate interest. However, since this is a sole proprietorship, the EIN application (if it exists) would contain personal SSNs and addresses, which the IRS would redact under privacy exemptions. It’s uncertain if the IRS would release even a redacted version, but it might be worth a try. Additionally, one could FOIA the Business Master File extract for North Carolina or the name “Amarlu” – the BMF contains basic entity info (for tax-exempt and taxable entities). Typically, only tax-exempt org data is freely available; business taxpayer info is protected. So this avenue may be limited. Another federal source is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN): starting in 2024, certain businesses will have to report beneficial owners; however, sole proprietorships are exempt. So nothing to get there in this case.
	•	US Postal Service Records: Since the misuse of the P.O. Box is central, a FOIA request to the USPS could yield the P.O. Box application and rental record for Box 3097 at Hickory, NC. When renting a PO Box, customers fill out PS Form 1093, providing their name, street address, and business name if any, along with two forms of ID. USPS keeps these on file. A FOIA request can be made to USPS for “PS Form 1093 and any associated box rental records for P.O. Box #3097 at the Hickory, NC post office, for the period covering 2023-present.” The USPS may have privacy concerns, but since this box is used for business, and the requester could argue there’s a public interest in revealing if false information was given (for example, did they list a fake physical address on the PO Box form too?), it’s possible to get at least a redacted copy. This would confirm who exactly is listed as the renter (likely one of the two owners) and what contact address they gave to the USPS. If, for instance, they provided a different street address on that form (or the same 231 Government Ave, which would be ironic), that could be evidence of intent to deceive. Also, USPS could have records if any complaints were lodged about that box or if any mail forwarding from that box was set up. These are internal but accessible via FOIA in theory.
	•	Florida State Records & Communications: To dig deeper on the Florida side, one could request records from:
	•	The Florida Department of State for any correspondence or enforcement actions involving an unregistered entity “Amarlu Enterprises”. Likely none exist unless someone complained to them. Florida DOS generally won’t know about an unregistered fictitious name until it’s brought to their attention.
	•	The Florida Department of Revenue for any information on tax remittances or inquiries related to rent from that property. Florida doesn’t have income tax, but if the property was rented, Florida DOR might require the payment of sales tax on commercial rent or short rentals (not on long-term residential). If, say, this was a short-term Airbnb type, Florida DOR would be very interested; but it appears to be a standard lease, so DOR might not be directly involved. However, a request could be “Records of any Florida tax filings or business tax registrations by Luther J. Rollins Jr. or Mary O. Polk or Amarlu Enterprises in relation to real estate or rental activity.” Florida DOR might say none, which itself is telling.
	•	The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) handles landlord/tenant complaints (in Florida, certain consumer complaints can be filed with the state, and FDACS or the Attorney General mediates). A FOIA/public records request could inquire if any consumer complaints were filed against these individuals or “Amarlu” in Florida. If the tenants filed a complaint with Florida Consumer Services or the Attorney General’s consumer division, that record could be obtained (with some redactions). That would shed light on official awareness of the issue.
	•	The Florida county clerk or courts: A search of court records in the county where the property is located could be done to see if any eviction or related lawsuits were filed by or against “Amarlu” or the individuals. That’s public (no FOIA needed, just court record search). We didn’t have evidence of a court case yet, but it’s something to monitor. If Rollins/Polk tried to sue for damages or eviction, they might have had to explain who Amarlu is in court – which could have legal ramifications given the lack of registration.
	•	FOIA to Law Enforcement or Regulatory Bodies: If one suspects serious fraud, one might FOIA any investigative records. For instance, Postal Inspectors (the law enforcement arm of USPS) or the NC Attorney General’s Office might have been contacted. However, if an investigation is ongoing or if complaints were referred, those records might be exempt or heavily redacted. Still, a request to NC Attorney General’s Consumer Protection division for any complaints or actions regarding Luther Rollins, Mary Polk, or “Amarlu” could be illuminating (the NC AG handles complaints about landlord-tenant issues in some cases, especially if a pattern of landlord fraud is alleged). Similarly, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) are unlikely to have anything here (this is not in their typical domain), so probably not relevant.
	•	Future Compliance Audits: If in the future the IRS or NC DOR audits the individuals for unreported income, that wouldn’t be public unless it results in a tax lien or prosecution. FOIA can’t really get us pending audit info due to privacy. But one could keep an eye out for any tax liens filed (which are public record) in the counties for federal or state taxes; none found as of now.

In summary, to go beyond the current public knowledge, targeted requests should be made to: the Catawba County Register of Deeds (for any amendments or notes on the assumed name filing), the NC Secretary of State (for complaints or investigations into the assumed name or related business practices), the NC Department of Revenue (to verify any business tax registration or enforcement actions), the USPS (for PO Box rental records), and Florida state agencies (for any filings or complaints involving the unregistered business). Each of these would provide a more complete audit trail of the landlords’ activities and any official scrutiny to date.

Below is a dedicated section with specific recommendations for next steps via FOIA or public records requests, including suggested wording to maximize the chances of obtaining useful information.

Recommended Next Steps – FOIA and Public Records Requests

To further investigate and gather evidence of any wrongdoing or to prompt enforcement action, the following specific requests are recommended. These will target the gaps in publicly available information and seek to obtain official records or confirmations. Each item lists the agency and the scope of the request:
	1.	Catawba County Register of Deeds (North Carolina) – Assumed Name Filings: Submit a public records request for any and all filings or documents related to the assumed business names “Amarlu Enterprises,” “Amarlu Company,” and “Amarlu Consulting” beyond the initial certificate. Specifically, ask for:
	•	Amendments or Withdrawals: “Please provide copies of any Amendment of Assumed Business Name or Withdrawal of Assumed Name forms filed for any business name containing ‘Amarlu’ from July 7, 2023 to present.” (This will confirm if the owners ever attempted to correct or cancel the filing.)
	•	Internal Correspondence/Notes: “Please provide any internal notes, correspondence, or communications in the Register of Deeds office regarding the assumed name certificate filed on July 7, 2023 for Amarlu Enterprises/Amarlu Company/Amarlu Consulting (Instrument #4119-… Book 3819/559-560).” Emphasize you are looking for any notes about the acceptability of the address, or communications with the filers.
Rationale: This will reveal if the county noticed the P.O. Box issue or if any communication was made to the filers to correct it. Even if nothing turns up, that is useful to know (it means the deception went through unchecked). Catawba County should have these records if, for example, they sent the certificate back for corrections or if an employee annotated it.
	2.	North Carolina Secretary of State – Business Registration Division – Enforcement and Complaints: Although assumed names are filed at the county level, the Secretary of State maintains the statewide index and has an interest in proper business conduct (the Secretary also handles complaints about unauthorized use of corporate designators, etc.). A request here could be:
	•	“Please provide any complaints, inquiry letters, or investigation records from January 2023 to present regarding Luther J. Rollins Jr. and/or Mary O. Polk doing business as ‘Amarlu Enterprises’ (or ‘Amarlu Company/Consulting’) or any record of non-compliance related to their assumed business name filings.”
	•	Also: “Provide any correspondence between the Secretary of State’s office and the Catawba County Register of Deeds (or with the above-named individuals) concerning the assumed name ‘Amarlu’ or its filing.”
Rationale: This may be a long shot, as many such issues are hyper-local. But if, say, the tenants or someone alerted the Secretary of State about a fraudulent filing or if the SoS has a file on business identity abuses, something could be on file. At minimum, the SoS might confirm that using a P.O. Box address violates the intended rules (they might have an internal memo on this). Even a response that “we have no records” is useful: it implies no one has complained at the state level yet.
	3.	North Carolina Department of Revenue (NCDOR) – Tax Registration Confirmation: Address a request to NCDOR’s public affairs or disclosure office along the lines of:
	•	“Please confirm whether any sales and use tax certificate, withholding tax account, or other business tax registration exists or has existed for the business names ‘Amarlu Enterprises,’ ‘Amarlu Consulting,’ or ‘Amarlu Company,’ or for Luther J. Rollins Jr. and Mary O. Polk operating a business at 231 Government Ave SW #3097 (or P.O. Box 3097) Hickory, NC. This request is for verification of business registration status for tax years 2023 and 2024.”
	•	If possible, also: “Please provide any notice of enforcement, delinquency, or audit issued to the above individuals or business names in 2023-2024 by NCDOR.” (They might not provide this, but it doesn’t hurt to ask in a FOIA context.)
Rationale: NCDOR might say, “we cannot disclose taxpayer info,” but they might at least state whether an account exists. In some states, whether a business has a sales tax license is public info. If they say “no account exists for Amarlu,” that tells us the owners never bothered to register anything, reinforcing the pattern of not formalizing the business. If an account does exist, that would be interesting (it would mean they did take one formal step we didn’t know about, perhaps for consulting income). Any enforcement notice (for example, if they failed to file personal income tax on the rent) would be extremely relevant, but such notices are usually not public until it becomes a lien. Still, asking flags to NCDOR that there’s concern – it might even prompt them to look at the case.
	4.	Internal Revenue Service (IRS) – EIN Application and Non-Profit Check: Under FOIA, request:
	•	“Any records of an Employer Identification Number (EIN) issuance to an entity or individual using the name ‘Amarlu Enterprises,’ ‘Amarlu Consulting,’ or ‘Amarlu Company.’ Specifically, a copy of or information from the SS-4 form if one was submitted for any of those names.” Provide identifying info like the date (post-July 2023) and the NC address to help their search.
	•	Also request: “A search of IRS Exempt Organizations records to confirm that no application for tax-exempt status (Forms 1023/1024) or Form 990 filings exist under the name ‘Amarlu’.” (We already know none exist, but an official confirmation is solid evidence of the for-profit nature and lack of filings.)
Rationale: The IRS might refuse the SS-4 citing privacy, but they sometimes release EIN confirmation letters for entities if you can show the entity is defunct or you’re a stakeholder. Since this isn’t a corporation, they’ll likely be cautious. However, even a response stating they “can neither confirm nor deny” or “no records found” is informative. If by chance an EIN was obtained, the application might list an address (did they use their home address? the P.O. box? another address?). That could be probative of intent (e.g., if they listed the PO Box as the physical place on an IRS form, that’s further evidence of misrepresentation, because IRS instructions ask for a physical location for the business). The non-profit query is just to double-confirm they didn’t try to do something odd like claim to be a charity (unlikely, but due diligence).
	5.	United States Postal Service (USPS) – P.O. Box Rental Records: FOIA request to USPS (likely the USPS Privacy or Records Office) specifying:
	•	“Copies of PS Form 1093 (Application for Post Office Box Service) and any associated customer records for P.O. Box number 3097 at the Hickory Post Office, 231 Government Ave SW, Hickory NC 28602/28603. Please include the box renter’s name(s), street address on file, date of application, and any listed business or organization name for that box. Also include any change-of-address or mail forwarding requests associated with P.O. Box 3097 from 2023 to present.”
Rationale: This is a crucial piece. The PO Box application will show who opened the box and what physical address they gave as a contact (USPS requires a physical residential address for the box holder, ironically to avoid anonymous use). If the address they gave is something unusual (or if they gave the Florida property address or some other address), that’s interesting. If they listed “Amarlu Enterprises” on the form as receiving mail, it shows they intentionally set up the business mailbox. If they didn’t list the business, it’s just under a personal name – which could mean mail addressed to Amarlu might not even be legally deliverable unless they added it as a valid recipient (USPS requires you to list names of individuals or businesses that will receive mail in the box). Getting these records will either validate that they followed USPS rules (listing their real home as contact, listing Amarlu as a valid recipient), or possibly show further misrepresentations (if they, for example, provided a false physical address or failed to disclose to USPS that the box would be used for a business).
	6.	Florida Department of State – Division of Corporations (Sunbiz) – Fictitious Name or Entity Search Certification: While we can search online, one can request an official letter or certificate from Sunbiz:
	•	“Please provide a certified search result indicating whether any active or inactive Florida fictitious name registration or Florida business entity exists for the name ‘Amarlu Enterprises’ (or ‘Amarlu Consulting/Company’). If none, please certify that no such records are found.”
Rationale: This creates a paper trail confirming non-registration in Florida. It’s essentially getting the Florida DOS to go on record that the business isn’t registered, which could be useful if pursuing legal action (showing a judge or officials that Florida has no record).
	7.	Florida Department of Revenue – Business Tax Receipt / Rental Taxes: Florida DOR might not have much since it’s a long-term rental, but possibly:
	•	“Please confirm if Luther J. Rollins Jr. or Mary O. Polk have any Florida Business Tax or Sales Tax account related to rental property at [property address]. Also, if any complaint or inquiry has been made or any investigation opened regarding unregistered rental business or unpaid taxes for that property.”
Rationale: Florida DOR might say there’s no sales tax due on long-term rents, but they might check if any such account exists. Florida also has county-level business tax receipts (basically a local license fee for doing business). Pinellas County (if that’s the location) issues a “Business Tax Receipt” for landlords who rent out property (some counties require it, some don’t enforce it strongly for just one rental). A quick check on the county’s tax collector site could see if the owners obtained one. If not, a request could be made to the county for any listing of landlords – likely they’re not on it.
	8.	Florida Attorney General / Consumer Services – Complaints: If the tenants or anyone filed a complaint:
	•	“Please provide any consumer complaints or inquiries on file (from 2023–2024) naming Luther J. Rollins Jr., Mary O. Polk, or ‘Amarlu Enterprises’ in connection with a rental property or business practices.”
Rationale: If a complaint was filed, these are often public (with personal identifying info redacted). It would detail the allegations and any response from the landlords. This could reveal more instances of misrepresentation or patterns of behavior (for example, if prior tenants had issues or if others reported them). If none exist, that implies no one has raised it to that level yet (which is possible if this is a first tenant dispute).
	9.	Local Florida County Records – Court Cases: Although not exactly FOIA, it is prudent to search the local county court dockets for any cases involving the owners. If none yet, nothing to request. But if there was, say, an eviction case (which might have been filed if tenants withheld rent due to these issues), one could get the court file which might contain interesting statements or evidence (like the landlords perhaps claiming to represent “Amarlu” or clarifying its status, etc.). This search can usually be done online via the Clerk of Court website.
	10.	United States Postal Inspection Service – Mail Fraud Inquiry: If one truly suspects mail fraud (using mail as part of a scheme to defraud, e.g., to collect money under false pretenses), a report can be made to the Postal Inspectors. They are not subject to FOIA in the sense that they won’t divulge ongoing investigations. However, one could FOIA the Postal Inspection Service for any consumer complaints or investigation records referencing the 231 Government Ave address or P.O. Box 3097 and Amarlu or the individuals. This is likely to be denied if an investigation is active or if it invades privacy. But it could be worth a shot after other info is gathered, or simply as a tip to encourage them to look into it.

Each of these requests should be phrased narrowly enough to zero in on relevant records, and cite relevant identifiers (names, dates, addresses, etc.). When filing FOIAs or public records requests, using the exact business names and personal names, and any file/case numbers (like the Register of Deeds instrument number) will help agencies locate the information. It’s often useful to mention the statutes (e.g., in NC: “This request is made pursuant to the NC Public Records Law, NCGS 132-1, et seq.”; for federal, cite FOIA 5 U.S.C. 552) to signal you know your rights.

Note on Public/Non-Public Distinction: All the above suggested inquiries are for information not readily available on a website. None of them ask for anything that’s explicitly protected (we avoid asking for the content of tax returns, for example, which we know is confidential). We instead target the existence of records or registrations, which agencies can often confirm without breaching confidentiality. The line can be thin (tax agencies are very cautious), but asking “is X registered or licensed?” is usually allowable. Where an agency likely cannot answer (like IRS about EIN tied to SSN), a FOIA may come back with a denial or no-records. That in itself is data: a “no records” from IRS could mean no EIN was ever issued for that name, or it could mean the request didn’t hit because it’s under individuals’ names – either way, it suggests the operation didn’t rise to a level that triggered IRS separate entity handling.

Finally, pursuing these next steps will provide a more robust picture and documentation. Publicly accessible records have given us the outline of a likely scheme of misrepresentation; the recommended FOIA and records requests can supply the details and official acknowledgments needed to proceed with any enforcement or legal action. They will either uncover new evidence of wrongdoing or at least officially document the current state of non-compliance, which can be just as powerful in holding the founders accountable.

# Legal Investigation: Stephen Boerner vs. Luther J. Rollins Jr.

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive legal investigation reveals a **mixed picture** regarding the claims made in the provided documentation. While several legal theories have solid statutory foundations and precedential support, significant gaps exist in factual verification of key allegations, and some characterizations appear substantially overstated. The damage estimates ($50,000-$155,000+) are legally supportable under Florida law,   but the likelihood of federal criminal prosecution and the viability of a coordinated “nuclear-level leverage” strategy require considerable qualification.

**The investigation finds that statutory frameworks support civil liability theories, but characterizations of “criminal enterprise” and federal prosecution likelihood are likely exaggerated beyond what the evidence and enforcement patterns actually support.**

## Attorney Licensing and Disciplinary Analysis

### Verification Status: Inconclusive

**No disciplinary records were found** for Luther J. Rollins Jr. across Missouri, Illinois, Texas, Florida, or North Carolina in publicly accessible databases.  However, this absence does not confirm clean licensing status, as many disciplinary proceedings remain confidential until probable cause determinations occur.

**Unlicensed practice penalties are substantial and well-established:**

- **Florida Statute §454.23**: Third-degree felony with up to 5 years imprisonment and $5,000 fines 
- **North Carolina General Statute §84-4**: Misdemeanor with additional civil liability and injunctive relief options 

**Critical gap**: Without definitive confirmation of Rollins’ current bar admission status in Florida or North Carolina, the unlicensed practice allegations remain unsubstantiated. The legal framework exists for enforcement, but **actual violations cannot be confirmed** based on available evidence. 

## Business Registration Compliance

### Verification Status: Significant Non-Compliance Risk

The investigation found **no registration records for AMARLU Enterprises** in North Carolina Secretary of State databases or Florida foreign entity registrations. This creates substantial legal exposure:

**Florida Foreign Entity Violations (§605.0902):**

- Cannot maintain legal proceedings until registered  
- Civil penalties of $500-$1,000 per year of non-compliance  
- Up to $1,000 daily penalties for failure to maintain registered agent 
- Liability for all fees and taxes that would have been imposed  

**The business registration violations appear to have stronger factual support** than the attorney licensing allegations, as the absence of registration records creates a rebuttable presumption of non-compliance.

## Federal Criminal Law Analysis

### Assessment: Technically Applicable but Prosecution Unlikely

**Federal mail and wire fraud statutes are extraordinarily broad** and technically encompass interstate communications about legal matters with fraudulent intent.  The elements are:

- **Mail Fraud (18 USC §1341)**: Scheme to defraud + use of mail 
- **Wire Fraud (18 USC §1343)**: Scheme to defraud + interstate wire communications 

**However, DOJ prosecution guidelines strongly favor cases affecting “classes of persons” over “isolated transactions between individuals.”**   Current federal prosecution patterns indicate **low likelihood** absent:

- Multiple victims across state lines
- Substantial financial losses (typically $100,000+)
- Systematic patterns of misconduct 

**The characterization of federal criminal exposure as likely prosecution appears overstated** based on enforcement patterns and DOJ resource allocation priorities.

## Florida Landlord-Tenant Law Validation

### Assessment: Strong Legal Foundation

**The statutory framework fully supports the damage theories presented:**

**Florida Statute §83.67** (Prohibited Practices):

- **Treble damages**: Actual damages OR 3 months’ rent, whichever is greater
- **Multiple violations** subject to separate damage awards 
- **Attorney fees mandatory** under §83.48 

**Florida Statute §83.49** (Security Deposits):

- **Complete forfeiture** of deposit claims for procedural violations
- **Strict compliance** required for notice requirements 

**Damage Range Assessment ($50,000-$155,000+):**
The research confirms this range is **realistic and well-supported**:

- **Lower end**: Single prohibited practice violation + attorney fees
- **Higher end**: Multiple violations with extensive litigation costs
- **Case precedent**: Awards like $184,340 in attorney fees on $53,195 damages demonstrate substantial recovery potential 

## Property and Parties Verification

### Assessment: All Parties Appear Legitimate

**Factual verification found no evidence of fraud or regulatory violations:**

- **2649 Tifton St S, Gulfport, FL**: Legitimate property with documented ownership history  
- **Compass Florida LLC**: Licensed real estate entity with active status 
- **Zach Steinberger**: Licensed real estate agent affiliated with Compass since 2015

**No public complaint records** were found against any of the named parties, though confidentiality provisions limit access to ongoing investigations.

This finding **undermines some allegations** about fraudulent real estate practices, as all parties appear to be operating legitimately within regulatory frameworks.

## RICO Civil Liability Analysis

### Assessment: More Viable Than Criminal Prosecution

**Civil RICO presents stronger prospects** than federal criminal prosecution:

- **Lower burden of proof** (preponderance vs. beyond reasonable doubt)
- **Private party initiation** without DOJ involvement required
- **Treble damages plus attorney fees** create powerful remedies 
- **Recent Supreme Court expansion** in *Medical Marijuana, Inc. v. Horn* (2025) broadens applicability 

**Pattern requirement achievable** with multiple interstate communications about legal services, but requires **demonstrable financial losses** and systematic conduct rather than isolated incidents. 

## Multi-Jurisdictional Coordination Assessment

### Finding: Established Mechanisms Exist but “Nuclear-Level Leverage” Overstated

**Precedent research confirms coordination mechanisms exist:**

- DOJ-state attorney general cooperation protocols
- Multi-state disciplinary coordination through NAAG
- Federal court reciprocal discipline procedures 

**However, the characterization of “nuclear-level leverage” appears exaggerated.** Successful coordination requires:

- Substantial public impact beyond individual disputes
- Resource justification across multiple jurisdictions
- Evidence of systematic rather than isolated violations 

**Current enforcement environment suggests reduced federal appetite** for cases without clear public protection imperatives.

## Critical Evaluation of Claims

### Well-Founded Legal Theories

**Strongly supported by law and precedent:**

1. Florida landlord-tenant statutory violations with treble damages 
1. Business registration non-compliance penalties  
1. Civil RICO liability framework 
1. Mandatory attorney fee recovery under Florida law 
1. Damage estimates within established precedent ranges 

### Overstated or Unsupported Claims

**Significantly exaggerated characterizations:**

1. **“Criminal enterprise” designation** - Not supported by evidence of systematic racketeering
1. **Federal prosecution likelihood** - DOJ patterns indicate low probability for described conduct  
1. **“Nuclear-level leverage”** - Coordination mechanisms exist but require substantial public impact justification 
1. **Unlicensed practice violations** - Cannot be confirmed without verified licensing status

### Factual Accuracy Assessment

**Major discrepancies identified:**

- Claims about fraudulent real estate practices **contradicted by verification** of legitimate licensing status
- Federal criminal characterizations **not supported by prosecution patterns** 
- Multi-jurisdictional strategy **viable but significantly less powerful** than portrayed 

## Strategic Viability Analysis

### Realistic Enforcement Probabilities

**High probability (70-85%):**

- Florida civil landlord-tenant violations 
- Business registration enforcement 
- Civil RICO claims with proper predicate development

**Moderate probability (40-60%):**

- Multi-state attorney discipline coordination 
- Significant damage recovery through settlement leverage

**Low probability (10-25%):**

- Federal criminal prosecution 
- “Coordinated nuclear-level” enforcement campaign 

### Practical Constraints

**Significant limiting factors:**

- **Resource requirements** for multi-jurisdictional litigation
- **Enforcement discretion** by prosecutors and regulators
- **Factual gaps** in key allegations
- **Federal prosecution standards** requiring substantial public impact  

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Overall Assessment: Partially Valid with Significant Qualifications

The legal research reveals a **legitimate foundation for civil enforcement action** under Florida landlord-tenant law with potential for substantial damage recovery.  However, **the characterization of federal criminal exposure and coordinated prosecution strategy appears substantially overstated** relative to actual enforcement patterns and evidentiary support.

### Key Takeaways

**Viable legal strategies:**

- Focus on Florida state law violations with strong precedential support 
- Pursue business registration enforcement through appropriate state agencies  
- Consider civil RICO claims with realistic expectations about predicate development 

**Questionable strategies:**

- Reliance on federal criminal prosecution as primary enforcement mechanism 
- Multi-jurisdictional coordination without substantial public impact demonstration 
- Claims requiring unverified factual allegations about licensing status

**The most realistic path forward involves state-level civil enforcement** rather than the coordinated federal prosecution strategy portrayed in the documentation. While significant damages remain recoverable under Florida law,   the “nuclear-level leverage” characterization lacks evidentiary support and overstates probable enforcement outcomes. 

This investigation demonstrates that while legitimate legal violations may exist, **the strategic approach and characterizations presented require substantial recalibration** to align with realistic enforcement probabilities and available evidence.
