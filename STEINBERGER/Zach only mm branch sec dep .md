# Legal Overview: Tenant's PTSD Disclosure and Property Retrieval Issues
## PTSD Disclosure and Extended Stay
### Purpose and Function
#### Tenant Stephen Boerner disclosed PTSD to Zach Steinberger on September 2, 2024, as a result of a violent home invasion on March 26, 2024.

#### The disclosure aimed to inform the agent of the tenant's mental health condition due to the landlord's failure to secure the property.

### Extended Stay Justification
#### Severe weather, moving service cancellations, and loss of alternative housing triggered Boerner's PTSD and a panic attack, extending his stay by two days.

#### Zach's role involved communicating these circumstances to the landlord, which he either failed to do or did without resulting action.

## Request for Property Retrieval
### Itemized Request for Personal Property
#### On September 3, 2024, Boerner requested the retrieval of valued items, such as commissioned artwork and a Weber grill, from the property.

#### Zach was responsible for forwarding this request, but either failed or delayed communication, hindering retrieval efforts.

### Legal Implications of Communication Failure
#### If Zach withheld information, it breached his professional duties, impacting Boerner's rights under Florida's abandoned property statutes (§§ 715.10–715.111).

#### The landlord is liable if informed and inactive, as agent knowledge is legally attributed to the landlord.

## Impact on Deposit Withholding
### Breach of Duty
#### Failure to communicate Boerner's PTSD and property requests compromises the legal grounds for withholding the security deposit.

#### The tenant's extended stay, influenced by PTSD and unforeseen events, does not justify retaining the deposit or denying property retrieval.

### Statutory Noncompliance and Bad Faith
#### Ignoring tenant disclosures and retrieval requests exposes Zach and the landlord to claims of negligence, bad faith, and statutory violations.

#### Negligence and bad faith claims relate to obstructing tenant rights and misrepresenting circumstances.

## Liability Allocation
### Agent's Role and Responsibility
#### Zach's communication lapses contribute to liability for the tenant's inability to retrieve property and emotional distress.

#### The landlord, as the principal, holds ultimate responsibility for the agent's actions, whether negligent or directive-driven.
