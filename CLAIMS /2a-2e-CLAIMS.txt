## 2a: CLAIM: Failure to Provide Notice of Abandoned Property - A Deliberate Violation of Tenant Rights

**Parties Involved:**

*   **Primary Responsible Party:** Luther Rollins (Landlord).

**Statute Violated:**

*   §715.104(1): “Notification of Former Tenant of Personal Property Left on Premises.” This statute mandates that landlords provide written notice to former tenants regarding personal property left on the premises, outlining the landlord’s intent to dispose of it if not claimed within a specified timeframe.

**Summary:** 

This claim addresses the landlord's deliberate failure to provide the legally required written notice regarding the tenant's abandoned personal property, which constitutes a clear violation of Florida law and a deliberate attempt to deprive the tenant of their right to retrieve their belongings.

**Claim Summary:**

*   The landlord, Luther Rollins, failed to issue any written notice to the tenant, Stephen Boerner, regarding personal property left on the premises, as explicitly required by Fla. Stat. §715.104(1). This was not a mere oversight; it was a deliberate act of noncompliance designed to circumvent the tenant’s right to retrieve their belongings.
*   This omission denied the tenant a reasonable opportunity to retrieve valuable belongings, including a Weber grill, commissioned artwork, and electronics, before they were unlawfully converted for the landlord’s use. This was not a minor inconvenience; it was a deprivation of the tenant’s property rights.
*   The landlord’s failure to provide the required written notice demonstrates a clear intent to disregard the tenant’s rights and to seize the tenant's personal property without following the legally mandated procedures. This was not a simple mistake; it was a deliberate act of bad faith.
*   The lease agreement, while outlining the terms of tenancy, does not negate the landlord's statutory obligation to provide proper notice regarding abandoned property. The landlord's reliance on the lease to justify his actions is a misrepresentation of the law.

**Evidence:**

1.  Lack of written notice from the landlord.
    *   The absence of any written notice from the landlord to the tenant regarding the personal property left behind, which is a direct violation of Fla. Stat. §715.104(1).
2.  Tenant communications requesting retrieval.
    *   Text messages, emails, or other written communications from the tenant, Stephen Boerner, demonstrating his attempts to coordinate the retrieval of his personal property, which the landlord ignored.

3.  Witness Testimony & Evidence
		*   A friend of the tenant, John Roman, visited the neighboring house at 2649 Tifton St. S. for a dinner party. This home shares a fence with the landlord's property, which, as of December 9, 2024, was partly knocked down due to a storm. This created a clear view from the neighbor's home into the backyard of 2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL. Unsolicited by the tenant in any way, both a witness and evidence emerged from the tenant's friend, as he noted in a text message: 
				*   "How’s mom? Interesting story. One of my friends, you probably never talked to or met him, but I have a lot at LT. He owns/lives at a house on the corner to the left of your old house. I went over to hang with him yesterday.The fence you share got blown down. His house got flooded a little, so yours might have as well. **FYI, your grill looks amazing in the backyard.** No one is renting there yet.
3.  A copy of the lease agreement between Stephen Boerner and Luther Rollins, Jr
    *   *Demonstrates the omission of any clause allowing for the landlord to dispose of personal property without notice:* This document shows that the lease agreement does not contain any clause that would allow the landlord to dispose of the tenant's personal property without providing the legally required notice.

**Case Law Support:**

*   *Goodwin v. Alexatos*, 584 So.2d 1007 (Fla. App. 1991): This case establishes that landlords must issue proper written notice before disposing of or converting a tenant’s personal property. A failure to provide this notice constitutes a violation of the tenant’s rights and can lead to liability for damages.

**Claim Amount:**

*   Supports statutory damages of $13,500, as three months’ rent exceeds the property’s value. This amount represents the minimum damages the tenant is entitled to under Fla. Stat. §715.109, and the landlord’s deliberate failure to comply with the law justifies the full amount.

## 2b: CLAIM: Unlawful Conversion of Personal Property - A Deliberate Act of Appropriation

**Parties Involved:**

*   **Primary Responsible Party:** 
			*   Luther Rollins (Landlord).

**Statute Violated:**

**Summary:** 

*   This claim addresses the landlord's deliberate and unlawful conversion of the tenant's personal property for his own use, demonstrating a blatant disregard for the tenant's property rights and a clear intent to benefit from his unlawful actions.

**Claim Summary:**

*   The landlord, Luther Rollins, unlawfully converted the tenant's personal property for his own use, including a Weber grill, commissioned artwork, and electronics. This was not a mere oversight; it was a deliberate act of appropriation, demonstrating a clear intent to benefit from the tenant's belongings without any legal justification.
*   By failing to follow the statutory notice and retrieval procedures outlined in Fla. Stat. §§ 715.10–715.111, the landlord violated the tenant’s rights and demonstrated a complete disregard for the tenant’s ownership of the property. This was not a simple mistake; it was a deliberate attempt to circumvent the law and to seize the tenant's belongings without any legal basis.
*   The landlord's actions are further compounded by the fact that he used the tenant's personal property, specifically the Weber grill, to market the rental property, which constitutes a clear act of conversion under Florida law. This was not a passive act; it was an active use of the tenant's property for the landlord’s own financial gain.
*   The lease agreement, while outlining the terms of tenancy, does not grant the landlord any right to convert the tenant's personal property for his own use. The landlord’s reliance on the lease to justify his actions is a misrepresentation of the law and a further demonstration of his bad faith.

**Evidence:**

1.  Screenshots of the live Zillow page created for 2649 Tifton St. S. Gulfport, FL 33711 for the intended use of marketing to new renters.

    *   The absence of any documentation from the landlord demonstrating compliance with the statutory notice and retrieval procedures further underscores the unlawful nature of his actions.
3.  A copy of the lease agreement between Stephen Boerner and Luther Rollins, Jr
    *   Demonstrates the absence of any clause allowing for the landlord to convert tenant property: This document shows that the lease agreement does not contain any clause that would allow the landlord to convert the tenant's personal property for his own use, further highlighting the unlawful nature of his actions.

**Case Law Support:**

*   *Goodwin v. Alexatos*, 584 So.2d 1007 (Fla. App. 1991): This case establishes that conversion of tenant property without proper notice triggers statutory damages and that landlords must strictly adhere to the statutory requirements for handling abandoned property.

**Claim Amount:**

*   Supports statutory damages of $13,500, as three months’ rent exceeds the property’s value. This amount represents the minimum damages the tenant is entitled to under Fla. Stat. §715.109, and the landlord’s deliberate failure to comply with the law justifies the full amount.

2c: CLAIM: Misrepresentation of Abandonment - A Deliberate Distortion of Truth and a Breach of Good Faith


**Parties Involved:**

*   **Primary Responsible Party:** 
			*   Luther Rollins (Landlord).
*   **Jointly Liable Parties:** 
			*   Zach Steinberger (Listing Agent)
			*   Compass Realty (Supervising Brokerage).

**Statute Violated:**

§715.104(1): “Notification of Former Tenant of Personal Property Left on Premises.” This statute requires landlords to act in good faith when addressing abandoned property and to provide proper written notice before disposing of or converting such property. The statute also implies a responsibility to interpret tenant communications reasonably and honestly.

**Summary:**

This claim addresses the landlord's deliberate and malicious misrepresentation of the tenant's communications regarding property retrieval, which constitutes a blatant attempt to fabricate an abandonment narrative, justify the unlawful retention of the tenant's belongings, and further demonstrate a pattern of bad faith.

Claim Summary:

The landlord, Luther Rollins, with the active assistance of his listing agent, Zach Steinberger, deliberately misrepresented the tenant’s communications regarding property retrieval to fabricate an abandonment narrative. This was not a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation; it was a calculated and intentional distortion of the truth designed to justify the unlawful retention of the tenant’s personal property.
The landlord selectively quoted a text message from the tenant, Stephen Boerner, to imply abandonment, while ignoring the full context of the communication, which clearly showed the tenant’s intent to retrieve his belongings. This was not a simple misinterpretation; it was a deliberate and malicious distortion of the truth designed to mislead and deceive. The landlord's actions were a clear attempt to circumvent the law.
The landlord’s misrepresentation of the tenant’s intent was not an isolated incident; it was part of a larger pattern of bad-faith actions designed to circumvent the requirements of Fla. Stat. §715.104(1) and to deprive the tenant of his rightful property. This was not a simple oversight; it was a deliberate attempt to create a false narrative to justify his unlawful actions and to avoid his legal obligations.
Zach Steinberger, as the listing agent, actively participated in this misrepresentation by failing to correct the landlord's mischaracterization of the tenant's communication and by supporting the landlord’s unlawful actions. This was not a passive oversight; it was an active participation in the landlord’s bad-faith tactics and a clear breach of his ethical obligations. Zach's actions demonstrate a lack of impartiality and a clear bias towards the landlord.
Compass Realty, as Zach Steinberger’s supervising brokerage, is also implicated in these violations. Their failure to adequately supervise Zach, allowing him to participate in the landlord's attempts to misrepresent the tenant’s communications, makes them jointly liable for the damages resulting from this misrepresentation. This failure to supervise constitutes a breach of their professional obligations and exposes them to potential legal and financial repercussions.
The lease agreement, while outlining the terms of tenancy, does not grant the landlord any right to misrepresent tenant communications or to disregard the tenant's stated intent to retrieve his belongings. The landlord’s reliance on the lease to justify his actions is a misrepresentation of the law and a further demonstration of his bad faith.
Evidence:

Tenant’s texts confirming retrieval attempts.
The full text of the tenant’s communication, which demonstrates his intent to retrieve his belongings, and his attempts to coordinate a retrieval time. This evidence directly refutes the landlord's claim of abandonment and highlights the landlord's bad faith.
Misquoted texts included in the landlord’s correspondence.
The landlord’s letter, which includes a partial and misleading quote from the tenant’s text message, demonstrates his deliberate attempt to misrepresent the tenant’s intent. This evidence highlights the landlord's bad faith and his willingness to distort the truth.
A copy of the lease agreement between Stephen Boerner and Luther Rollins, Jr.
Demonstrates the absence of any clause allowing for the landlord to misrepresent tenant communications: This document shows that the lease agreement does not contain any clause that would allow the landlord to misrepresent tenant communications or disregard the tenant's stated intent to retrieve his belongings, further highlighting the unlawful nature of his actions.
Case Law Support:

Goodwin v. Alexatos, 584 So.2d 1007 (Fla. App. 1991): This case establishes that landlords must act in good faith when interpreting tenant communications regarding property and that misrepresentation of a tenant's intent to abandon property is a violation of the tenant’s rights. The court emphasized that landlords must act with honesty and transparency when dealing with tenant property.
Claim Amount:

Contributes to statutory damages of $13,500, with joint liability for Luther Rollins, Zach Steinberger, and Compass Realty. This amount represents the minimum damages the tenant is entitled to under Fla. Stat. §715.109, and the landlord’s deliberate misrepresentation of the tenant’s communications further demonstrates his bad faith and justifies the full amount.
