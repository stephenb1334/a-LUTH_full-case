Luther Rollins,2024-06-08 17:16:30,,,,SMS,Outgoing,,,Read,,,"Hi Luther, i made a clerical error in managing the account our rent checks pull from. The last check appears to have not processed. Did you experience that as well? If so, i believe that voids the written check. I will promptly send another if that is the case. In the same envelop i will also provide a second check for $4,500 for the month of July 2024. And we paid August's rent in the down payment at time of lease signing as August is the last month of our lease. 

Please respond as soon as possible regarding the June rent payment. I can also fedex a flat-rate envelope for June and July rent checks to expedite this. Thank you",,
Luther Rollins,2024-06-10 12:32:38,,,,SMS,Outgoing,,,Read,,,"Hi luther, spoke to melissa. $4,500/month is higher than we would prefer coming into this phase in life. 

She brought up good points i agree with and found an alternative im seeing shortly. Let's call it 'nesting.' This is where i follow her lead and put my preferences on the back burner. Mamma instinct kickin in which is a beautiful thing to see. 

That said, one option she was open to was a 1 or two month extension without the commitment to extend. But the price would need to be less. 

I respect, and understand, you and your wife's stance in terms of pricing such a perfect home. For the sake of collecting answers for Melissa, are you open to a decreased monthly cost for 1 or 2 months. If yes,I can take that to Melissa and have an answer no later than Wednesday morning so we can agree or not agree on extending. Not extending at lower monthly for 1-2 months would mean we would move on and say goodbye/thank you and pursue ensuring our security deposit by leaving the home in good standing as it exists today.",,

Good info and update. I will discuss with my wife shortly and get back to you. Please keep in mind that the $4500 was a flat rent and we paid all utilities, electric, internet etc. So, not too high for a 2/2 house w/yard. Did you overnight the June rent check? This is now 10 days past due.
Thanks!",,
Luther Rollins,2024-06-11 11:37:41,,,,SMS,Outgoing,,,Read,,,"Luther, 

Please compensate yourself for our late June payment. I can either send a late fee via check or you can deduct the late fee from the security deposit. Or, however you would prefer. Its not right to be this late and its my responsibility. No favors please. 

The June and July checks were sent via USPS. I asked they be FedEx overnighted but she didnt have time to go inside a fedex and my golf cart is currently out of commission. Doesnt matter the reasons just know that both June and July rent checks are in the mail. Both checks are dated June 10th 2024 so you can deposit July early. Our accounts are restored with more than enough to cover both checks. Wont have an issue. 

Again, i apologize for this. I understand the frustration and any concern. With the June and July check en route to you, once processed, we are all paid up through August 31st as August was paid as part of the first/last/security deposit paid upfront at lease signing. 

As of now, we will plan to be out of the house by August 31st as i dont blame you for not wanting to offer discounted months after August 31st when the 10-month lease concludes. 

Thank yoy.",,

Thanks for the update. Hope you get the golf cart up and going. Would a discounted one month (Sept.) extender be useful for you & Melissa?

Also, thank you for the kindness and support as we will pay that forward to others, especially renters of ours. 

Feel free to share the extension paperwork to my personal email and i will expedite. If youd like payment front, i am happy to send a check sooner than later to ensure we all feel good about it.

Has shifted with new information . 

I speak from both Melissa and I when I say thank you for a wonderful stay and being a great landlord

our need to extend into a single, discounted month has shifted and to declining that option as a result of new life information on our end in which I will spare you the detail but all is positive.

That said we are opting to not sign the one month extension and I thank you for expediting it. 

60 days from today is August 31, 2024 which marks the last day of our lease that is currently in agreement.",,

Will you be stopping by any time today? or perhaps tomorrow or Monday? If so, I will leave them here for you as well as Zach. If not, I won't let them spoil and no problem at all. Wrapped up, it could last a week or so in the fridge here at the house as well
