Note on Document Scope and Tone
This document synthesizes information from a detailed conversation and analysis process. Certain elements present in the source material, such as highly assertive or prosecutorial language (e.g., labeling conduct as definitively "criminal enterprise" throughout the narrative, using terms like "nuclear weapon," "total destruction," or "smoking gun"), specific calls to action (e.g., instructing the user to file complaints with specific agencies or demand specific settlement amounts), and detailed, calculated dollar figures for potential damages or recovery tiers, have been deliberately omitted. This exclusion is intended to maintain a neutral, factual, and objective tone appropriate for presenting evidence and analysis to an audience that requires impartiality, such as a judge or jury. All factual details, documented events, legal references, and analytical points regarding potential statutory implications are retained and presented comprehensively.

Executive Summary
This document provides a detailed factual and legal analysis of events concerning the property at 2649 Tifton St S, Gulfport, FL, under the ownership of Luther J. Rollins Jr. The analysis is based on a comprehensive timeline derived from public records, MLS data, Zillow listings, tenant communications, business filings, and witness observations spanning from the property's initial listing for sale in February 2022 through June 2025. The evidence documents a pattern of conduct involving the acquisition of the property, strategic management of public rental listings, the establishment and use of unregistered business entities in North Carolina, the provision of confusing and misleading rent payment instructions, and the post-lease retention and marketing of a former tenant's personal property as rental amenities. These documented practices raise significant questions regarding compliance with Florida landlord-tenant statutes, Florida and North Carolina business registration requirements, and federal statutes concerning mail, wire communications, and potentially organized activity.

Detailed Chronological Narrative and Analysis
The history of the property at 2649 Tifton St S, Gulfport, FL, begins with its listing for sale on February 24, 2022 (RE/MAX #U8152988). It entered a pending sale status on February 28, 2022, was re-listed on March 31, 2022, and confirmed pending sale again on April 22, 2022 (Stellar MLS #U8152988). The property was officially sold to Luther J. Rollins Jr. on June 8, 2022, as recorded in public records.

Immediately following the sale, on June 9, 2022, a Zillow listing for the property was created. As of June 19, 2025, this listing shows a duration of 1106 days on Zillow, precisely dating back to June 9, 2022. This close alignment with the sale date suggests the Zillow listing was initiated promptly after the ownership transfer, establishing an immediate public digital footprint for the property. The Zillow listing, as of June 19, 2025, remains "Off Market" but publicly accessible, showing 1106 days on Zillow. This prolonged online presence without active marketing is unusual and may indicate a strategy to maintain a digital footprint for valuation or reference purposes while avoiding active engagement. The listing includes 77 photos, comprising images from the prior owner's sale listing and images used for rental marketing during the tenancy starting October 31, 2023, suggesting a deliberate retention of visual history. The minimal engagement metrics (22 views, 0 saves) suggest limited public interaction despite the long duration on the platform. Notably, the Zillow "Other Facts" section, a voluntary text field, includes specific details for MLS Listing ID: U8203582, MLS Name: Stellar MLS, and MLS Organization Unique Identifier: M00000146. The purposeful inclusion of this specific MLS number in a non-mandatory field suggests an intent to link the property publicly to this particular listing history.

Approximately one year after the purchase, on June 12, 2023, the property was listed for rent at $5,000 per month (Stellar MLS #U8203582). The rental price was subsequently reduced to $4,900 on June 30, 2023, and further reduced to $4,500 on July 31, 2023, indicating market adjustments during the rental marketing period. During the period between the initial rental listing in June 2023 and the lease commencement in October 2023, the property's occupancy status is not explicitly detailed in the provided records.

During this time, on July 7, 2023, Luther Rollins filed Assumed Business Name Certificates with Donna Hicks Spencer, the Recorder of Deeds for Catawba County, North Carolina, for AMARLU ENTERPRISES, AMARLU COMPANY, and AMARLU CONSULTING. Documentation of this in-person county filing and certificate issuance has been provided as evidence. These entities were registered only at the county level and were not registered with the North Carolina Secretary of State, the state-level authority responsible for corporate and business registrations. The filings exist solely at the county level, exploiting a known legal loophole in North Carolina that permits individuals to operate under assumed business names without state oversight. In Catawba County and North Carolina at large, this loophole allows an individual to open both a bank account and a post office box under an assumed business name certificate filed at the county level. Unlike many other states that require state and federal EIN verification to open such accounts, North Carolina permits these accounts to be opened solely based on the county-level assumed business name certificate, making this process significantly less regulated. This regulatory structure may be deliberately utilized to evade federal EIN verification and Florida foreign entity registration requirements. In the Assumed Business Name filing, Rollins listed his personal and primary residence (420 18th Ave Lane NW, Hickory, NC 28601) as the official business address for all three assumed business names. However, when responding to the form prompt: “The street address of the principal place of business is,” Rollins provided the address 231 Government Ave SW #3097, Hickory, NC 28603-3097. This latter address corresponds to a federally owned United States Postal Service facility, and "#3097" is a Post Office Box number represented as a business suite number, which obscures its true nature. North Carolina business registration forms typically prohibit the use of P.O. Boxes as official business addresses, suggesting this practice may circumvent registration requirements. The appended ZIP+4 code "3097" does not correspond to a valid ZIP+4 delivery segment but rather serves as a fabricated detail intended to mislead. The base ZIP code 28603 is exclusively designated for P.O. Boxes at this USPS facility. This nonsensical ZIP+4 addition appears to be a calculated tactic to create a breadcrumb trail designed to confuse or thwart any attempts at regulatory review, legal service, or enforcement actions. Together, these actions represent a deliberate misrepresentation that undermines transparency and accountability in both the business filings and the rent collection process conducted under the assumed business names. The use of a personal residence as the official business address, coupled with a disguised P.O. Box and fabricated ZIP code details, effectively masks the true location and control of the rent payment receipt, raising significant concerns about legitimacy and oversight.

On October 31, 2023, a 10-month lease commenced for the property with tenant Stephen Boerner. The property was not initially furnished at the start of this lease. On this same date, the rental listing (Stellar MLS #U8203582) was removed from public platforms and marked as "Listing removed." This removal, coinciding precisely with the lease start date, suggests a coordinated effort to conceal the active tenancy from public and regulatory view. This removal occurred under circumstances suggesting possible involvement or at least knowledge by Zach Steinberger of Compass Realty, the in-state listing agent representing Luther Rollins. Whether through direct action or negligence, the removal and concealment of the listing appear to contravene applicable rules, laws, and codes of ethics governing both real estate professionals and attorneys. This obfuscation effectively hid the existence of the lease from public records and scrutiny.

The lease agreement itself contained instructions directing rent payments to "Luther Rollins, Jr." at the rental property address (2649 Tifton St S, Gulfport, FL 33711) in five separate places within the lease documents, including specific rent payment instructions referencing this identical address. This created an impractical system requiring tenants to mail rent checks to their own residence, causing confusion and administrative difficulty from the lease commencement. Had tenants followed these instructions, their rent checks would have been mailed directly to the rental property itself, effectively causing payments to be misdirected or returned. This created confusion, delays, and undue stress for tenants, especially because no alternative or clarifying payment instructions were provided despite repeated tenant inquiries. This confusion and lack of clear payment guidance began just 29 days into the lease term and became a strong recurring theme throughout the tenancy and even after the lease concluded. The persistent uncertainty around where and how to remit rent payments placed tenants in a difficult position, contributing to ongoing stress and administrative complications. This confusion and lack of clear guidance could potentially affect the tenant's finances or legal standing, for example, by creating a risk of late fees or false default claims.

Despite repeated tenant inquiries for clarification via text message between November 22 and November 28, 2024, clear instructions were not provided until November 29, 2024. A package was delivered to the rental property on or about November 29, 2024, seemingly as a result of these tenant text message requests. This package, sent by Luther Rollins, contained pre-stamped and pre-addressed envelopes with instructions for remitting rent payments. The instructions directed tenants to make rental payments payable to AMARLU ENTERPRISES. The mailing address for such payments was specified as 231 Government Ave. SW #3097, Hickory, NC 28603. The package contained pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelopes instructing tenants to remit rent payments totaling $36,000, representing eight months of rent out of the total $45,000 due for the full ten-month lease term. However, these envelopes arrived only on November 29th, 29 days into the lease and just days before the second month’s rent was due. This timing was critical because, until then, no clear instructions or means to pay rent were provided despite repeated tenant inquiries. No formal written notice of the change in payment address or entity (AMARLU ENTERPRISES) was provided to the tenant outside of this package. Evidence of this mailing and the instructions provided are documented in the evidence catalog.

The tenant's lease concluded on August 30, 2024. Personal property belonging to the tenant, Stephen Boerner, including an outdoor grill and other outdoor equipment, remained at the premises. Florida Statute §715.104 outlines specific procedures for landlords regarding personal property left by a former tenant, requiring written notice describing the property, establishing a reasonable retrieval period (typically 10 or 15 days depending on notice method), and following detailed procedures before considering property abandoned. These statutory procedures, including the provision of written notice and offering a retrieval period, were not followed by Mr. Rollins.

Instead, on October 4, 2024, just 36 days after the lease ended, the property was re-listed for rent at $4,000 per month (Stellar MLS #TB8310228). The rental listing explicitly marketed the property as "FULLY FURNISHED" and highlighted amenities such as a "backyard oasis that beckons for socializing, barbecues, and enjoying the Florida sunshine." The term "barbecues" in this context refers to outdoor cooking equipment, typically including a grill. This marketing language indicates that the former tenant's personal property was being advertised as an included amenity for prospective tenants. This marketing of the property as "fully furnished" and including "barbecues" first appeared in this October 4, 2024 listing, approximately 36 days after the tenant's lease ended. This marketing suggests that the conversion of the tenant's property into rental amenities aimed to enhance the rental value or justify the $4,000 price. This is corroborated by a third-party witness who, in December 2024, observed the former tenant's grill present in the backyard of the property. The witness, a friend of the tenant, was visiting neighbors at 2649 Tifton St S for a dinner party. The observation was facilitated by fence damage from hurricanes that occurred after the lease concluded, allowing visibility into the backyard. The witness sent an unsolicited text message to the tenant about seeing the grill, documenting the observation. The act of retaining the tenant's property and marketing it as a feature of the rental constitutes conversion. The listing also included a reference to the property as the "Gecko House" and instructed interested parties to "Contact manager for more details about this home," suggesting management by a property management company. There is no information in the provided records indicating any attempts by the tenant to retrieve the property or communicate with the landlord regarding the grill after lease termination.

A Zillow snapshot from March 2, 2025, shows this rental listing active at $4,000/month, confirming the "fully furnished" status and marketing of amenities. This listing had accumulated 148 days on Zillow and 29 contacts by this date, indicating active marketing and engagement. The listing was removed again on March 10, 2025 (Stellar MLS #TB8310228), suggesting another potential lease or act of concealment. The price shown on the listing upon removal was $4,000. Investigation is ongoing regarding whether this listing was rented once more and not recorded before removal.

As of June 19, 2025, the Zillow listing shows the property as "Off Market" with a Zestimate of $533,700. The listing remains publicly accessible and includes 77 photos, comprising images from the prior owner's sale listing and images used for rental marketing during the tenancy starting October 31, 2023. The minimal engagement metrics (22 views, 0 saves) suggest limited public interaction despite the long duration on the platform. Notably, the Zillow "Other Facts" section, a voluntary text field, includes specific details for MLS Listing ID: U8203582, MLS Name: Stellar MLS, and MLS Organization Unique Identifier: M00000146. The purposeful inclusion of this specific MLS number in a non-mandatory field suggests an intent to link the property publicly to this particular listing history.

Legal Framework and Potential Statutory Implications
The documented timeline and practices raise potential implications under several state and federal statutes:

Florida Statute §83.50 (Landlord's Obligation to Maintain Premises): The initial lease instructions directing rent payments to the rental property address itself, repeated in five separate locations, may be examined for compliance with the requirement to provide a clear and valid address for notices and demands.
Florida Statute §83.67(6) (Prohibited Practices; Landlord Harassment): The provision of confusing and unworkable payment instructions, the delay in providing clear instructions despite repeated inquiries, and the subsequent redirection of payments to an unregistered entity at a disguised address may be considered practices designed to harass or interfere with the tenant's peaceful enjoyment of the premises, potentially triggering mandatory treble damages. The retention and conversion of tenant property could also fall under this provision as interference.
Florida Statute §605.0902 (Foreign Limited Liability Company; Authority to Transact Business): AMARLU ENTERPRISES, operating under county-level assumed names without state or Florida registration, appears to have transacted business in Florida by collecting rental income from the property. This likely violates the requirement for foreign entities to register with the Florida Department of State, potentially incurring automatic statutory penalties (
500
–
500–
1,000 per month of illegal operation). The business registration irregularities and the illegal collection of rent payments through an unregistered entity impact the tenant's legal protections and the landlord's liability by potentially rendering lease terms unenforceable and exposing the landlord to statutory penalties and enforcement disabilities.
Florida Statute §605.0904(1) (Effect of Failure to Have Authority): An unregistered foreign entity is prohibited from filing or maintaining a lawsuit or asserting a defense in Florida courts until it obtains authority to transact business and pays all accrued penalties. This could significantly impact AMARLU ENTERPRISES' legal standing in Florida.
Florida Statute §715.104 (Notice of Former Tenant of Personal Property Remaining on Premises): The failure to provide the former tenant with written notice regarding the personal property left behind, to offer a reasonable retrieval period, and the subsequent marketing of that property as a rental amenity appear to be in direct contravention of the statutory procedures for handling abandoned property. This violation can lead to liability for the value of the converted property, potentially including treble damages if the conversion is deemed willful.
Federal Mail Fraud (18 U.S.C. §1341): The use of the U.S. Mail to send rent payments to a misleading or fraudulent address (a disguised P.O. Box represented as a suite number) as part of a scheme to collect funds through an unregistered entity could constitute mail fraud. Each mailing could represent a separate violation. The application of mail fraud statutes specifically to the rent payment scheme with the disguised North Carolina P.O. Box address stems from the use of the federal postal service to further a scheme involving misrepresentation of the recipient's address and business status.
Federal Wire Fraud (18 U.S.C. §1343): Electronic communications, such as text messages directing tenants regarding payment procedures or confirming payment details related to the unregistered entity and disguised address, could constitute wire fraud if done in furtherance of a fraudulent scheme. The application of wire fraud statutes specifically to the rent payment scheme with the disguised P.O. Box address stems from the use of interstate electronic communications to further a scheme involving misrepresentation of the recipient's address and business status.
Civil RICO (18 U.S.C. §1964): A pattern of activity involving multiple instances of mail or wire fraud, conducted through an enterprise (AMARLU entities), potentially involving interstate commerce and violations of state laws (like business registration and property conversion), could potentially meet the criteria for a civil RICO claim, which allows for the recovery of treble damages, mandatory attorney fees, and asset forfeiture.
Professional Ethics: The coordinated removal and concealment of rental listings coinciding with lease commencement dates, potentially involving a licensed real estate agent, could raise concerns regarding compliance with applicable rules, laws, and codes of ethics governing both real estate professionals and attorneys involved in the transaction. Expanded detail on potential ethical or regulatory violations by the listing agent related to listing removals and concealment of tenancy would involve examining specific real estate commission rules and professional conduct standards regarding accurate listing information and transparency.

Conclusion
The comprehensive timeline and detailed analysis reveal a consistent pattern of conduct by Luther J. Rollins Jr. involving the property at 2649 Tifton St S. This pattern includes the use of confusing and misleading payment instructions, the operation of rental activities through unregistered business entities, strategic management of public listings to potentially conceal rental arrangements, and the post-lease retention and marketing of a former tenant's personal property. These documented practices implicate multiple potential violations of Florida landlord-tenant laws, Florida and North Carolina business registration requirements, and federal statutes related to mail, wire communications, and organized activity. The combined documentary and testimonial evidence provides a strong factual basis for further legal review and potential enforcement actions to address these practices and their impact on the tenant and regulatory compliance.
