The 2022 deed significantly deviates from standard Florida templates by:

Using "THIS DEED" instead of "THIS WARRANTY DEED" in the title
Omitting the traditional "TO HAVE AND TO HOLD" habendum clause stewartcom
Using "do grant, transfer and convey" instead of statutory "granted, bargained and sold" language Deeds
Including inappropriate contract-style clauses as previously noted Chesser & Barr, P.A.

These deviations from standard templates, while not necessarily invalidating the deed, create unnecessary ambiguity and suggest the 2022 deed may have been drafted without proper understanding of Florida warranty deed requirements.
