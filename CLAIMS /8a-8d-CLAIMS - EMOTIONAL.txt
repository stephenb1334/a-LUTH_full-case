Failure to Maintain Habitable Premises and Address Emotional Distress – A Pattern of Negligence and Bad Faith

Parties Involved:

Plaintiff: Stephen Boerner (Tenant)
Defendant: Luther Rollins (Landlord)
Statutory Violations:

Fla. Stat. §83.51(1)(a): Failure to comply with applicable housing and health codes to maintain premises in a habitable and safe condition.
Fla. Stat. §83.51(2)(a): Failure to provide reasonable provisions for locks, gates, and structural safety features essential for tenant security and well-being.
Summary of Claim:

This claim arises from the Defendant’s repeated and willful failure to comply with statutory obligations under Florida law, specifically Fla. Stat. §83.51. The Defendant’s pattern of neglect, coupled with bad-faith attempts to dismiss the Plaintiff’s legitimate concerns, directly resulted in a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, created an unsafe living environment, and exacerbated the Plaintiff’s emotional distress, leading to significant damages.

Factual Allegations:

March 26, 2024: Home Invasion, Initial Neglect, and Awareness of Criminal Threat

On March 26, 2024, a home invasion occurred at the premises located at 2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL, where the Plaintiff was residing. The Plaintiff immediately notified the Defendant via text message. Specifically, at 12:02:55 on March 26, 2024, the Plaintiff informed the Defendant: "Hi Luther, we had a break-in last night... The police were on site, report filed, and charges pressed... I’d like to document this with you so you are fully aware.”
The intruder gained access to the property through a side gate that was in a state of disrepair, lacking a functional locking mechanism and exhibiting deteriorated wood.
Crucially, during a phone conversation on March 26, 2024, immediately following the Plaintiff’s notification, the Defendant himself described the gate's condition as "deteriorated," acknowledging the severe structural deficiency that rendered it incapable of providing adequate security. Furthermore, in the same conversation, the Defendant considered a more permanent solution, suggesting that the gates "should just be replaced with metal gates," indicating his awareness that the existing wooden gates were beyond simple repair and that a more robust, secure solution was necessary. This acknowledgment underscores the Defendant’s responsibility to take immediate action to rectify the security breach, a responsibility he demonstrably failed to fulfill.
The Plaintiff shared the intruder's arrest record with the Defendant, revealing a history of 40 arrests and nine felonies, many of which were for similar crimes. The Plaintiff explicitly stated in the March 26th text message: "His mindset is vengeful, and no one can tell me we aren’t on his hit list for pressing trespassing charges."
The Defendant acknowledged the severity of the intruder's criminal history, stating, "The perpetrator sounds like a bad person and repeat petty criminal." By using the word "repeat," the Defendant acknowledged the safety risk posed by a criminal who repeatedly commits crimes.
The Defendant’s failure to secure the property created a foreseeable risk of intrusion, which ultimately materialized in the form of the home invasion.
March 28, 2024: Repeated Requests for Security and Defendant’s Inadequate Response

On March 28, 2024, the Plaintiff followed up with the Defendant, expressing significant fear for personal safety and specifically requesting essential security improvements. In a text message sent at 17:59:26, the Plaintiff stated: "Now, knowing what I know about his background, I’m worried about us living here. I think it will dissipate in time, but I need to decide what to do vs what not to do. Either way, I’d like to get cameras to alert us with motion detectors. We’d also feel safer with metal, lockable gates. As of now, they don’t lock, and he knows that."
The Plaintiff's use of the term "metal, lockable gates" was specifically chosen to mirror the Defendant's own words from the March 26th conversation, where the Defendant himself suggested that the gates "should just be replaced with metal gates" as a more effective and permanent solution, rather than simply repairing the deteriorated wooden gates. This demonstrates that the Plaintiff was not only aware of the need for a more robust solution, but was also echoing the Defendant's own assessment of the situation.
The Defendant’s response was inadequate and demonstrated a lack of concern for the Plaintiff’s well-being. The Defendant offered only superficial remedies, stating, "I’m okay with you getting motion detector cameras as long as no drilling," an absurd response that limited the available options and placed the financial burden on the Plaintiff. The Defendant also suggested, "Also maybe put a plastic sign in the yard that says video surveillance. Might be a deterrent too," again placing the responsibility on the Plaintiff and offering a cheap solution to a serious security breach.
The Defendant stated, "I hear you and agree it might be best to not press charges. And hopefully never see this guy again." The Defendant's use of "hopefully" demonstrates a lack of empathy for the Plaintiff's situation, as the Defendant, living out of state, was merely "hoping" for the best while doing nothing to address the safety concerns.
The Defendant stated, "Let’s hope in the end this is an isolated and 1-time only event," despite acknowledging the intruder's criminal record and the Plaintiff's fear of retaliation. This demonstrates a pattern of minimizing the risk and failing to take appropriate action.
The Defendant’s failure to take reasonable steps to secure the premises following the home invasion constitutes a further breach of his obligations under Fla. Stat. §83.51.
Pattern of Neglect: Unsanitary Living Conditions

Between January 10, 2024, and January 25, 2024, the Plaintiff reported a severely clogged kitchen sink, resulting in stagnant water and unsanitary living conditions.
Despite multiple requests for assistance, the Defendant failed to respond or take any action to remedy the situation, forcing the Plaintiff to resolve the issue independently.
This incident demonstrates a pattern of neglect and a further violation of Fla. Stat. §83.51(2)(a), which requires landlords to maintain functional plumbing.
Pattern of Bad Faith: Coercive Communication and Misrepresentation

After the Plaintiff sent a formal dispute letter on October 28, 2024, the Defendant engaged in a pattern of coercive communication, including multiple phone calls and voicemails within two-hour intervals on October 29, 2024, despite the Plaintiff’s explicit request for written correspondence.
The Defendant misrepresented legal obligations by falsely claiming in a text message on October 29, 2024, that both parties were “supposed to” speak by phone to resolve the dispute, thereby attempting to circumvent the Plaintiff’s preference for documented communication.
These actions demonstrate a pattern of bad faith and an attempt to intimidate the Plaintiff, further exacerbating the emotional distress caused by the initial security breach.
Delayed Onsite Inspection and Neglect of Motion Light Issue

The Defendant visited the property on April 21, 2024, and April 22, 2024, for what he described as "maintenance," not specifically to assess the security issues. This visit occurred nearly a month after the home invasion on March 26, 2024, highlighting a significant delay in addressing the Plaintiff's safety concerns.
During the onsite visit on April 22, 2024, the Plaintiff notified the Defendant of a faulty motion light in the backyard.
On April 26, 2024, at 20:55:57, the Plaintiff sent the Defendant a video demonstrating the faulty motion light at night, reiterating the concern. The Defendant completely failed to respond to this text message, demonstrating a continued pattern of neglect and disregard for the Plaintiff's safety concerns.
