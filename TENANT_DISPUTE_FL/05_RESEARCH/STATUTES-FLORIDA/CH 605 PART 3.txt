605.0703 Procedure for judicial dissolution; alternative remedies.—
(1) Venue for a proceeding brought under s. 605.0702 lies in the circuit court of the county where the limited liability company’s principal office is or was last located, as shown by the records of the department, or, if there is or was no principal office in this state, in the circuit court of the county where the company’s registered office is or was last located.
(2) It is not necessary to make members parties to a proceeding to dissolve a limited liability company unless relief is sought against such members individually.
(3) A court in a proceeding brought to dissolve a limited liability company may issue injunctions, appoint a receiver or custodian pendente lite with all powers and duties the court directs, take other action required to preserve the limited liability company’s assets wherever located, and carry on the business of the limited liability company until a full hearing can be held.
(4) In a proceeding brought under s. 605.0702, the court may, upon a showing of sufficient merit to warrant such a remedy:
(a) Appoint a receiver or custodian under s. 605.0704;
(b) Order a purchase of a petitioning member’s interest pursuant to s. 605.0706; or
(c) Upon a showing of good cause, order another remedy the court deems appropriate in its discretion, including an equitable remedy.
(5) Section 57.105 applies to a proceeding brought under s. 605.0702.
History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180.
605.0704 Receivership or custodianship.—
(1) A court in a judicial proceeding brought to dissolve a limited liability company may appoint one or more receivers to wind up and liquidate or one or more custodians to manage the business and affairs of the limited liability company. The court shall hold a hearing, after notifying all parties to the proceeding and an interested person designated by the court, before appointing a receiver or custodian. The court appointing a receiver or custodian has exclusive jurisdiction over the limited liability company and all of its property, wherever located.
(2) The court may appoint a person authorized to act as a receiver or custodian. The court may require the receiver or custodian to post bond, with or without sureties, in an amount the court directs.
(3) The court shall describe the powers and duties of the receiver or custodian in its appointing order, which may be amended. Among other powers:
(a) The receiver:
1. May dispose of all or a part of the assets of the limited liability company, wherever located, at a public or private sale, if authorized by the court; and
2. May sue and defend in the receiver’s own name, as receiver of the limited liability company, in all courts of this state; and
(b) The custodian may exercise all of the powers of the limited liability company, through or in place of its managers or members, to the extent necessary to manage the activities and affairs of the limited liability company in the best interest of its members and creditors.
(4) During a receivership, the court may redesignate the receiver as a custodian and, during a custodianship, may redesignate the custodian as a receiver if doing so is in the best interests of the limited liability company and its members and creditors.
(5) During the receivership or custodianship the court may order compensation paid and expense disbursements or reimbursements made to the receiver or custodian and the receiver’s or custodian’s counsel from the assets of the limited liability company or proceeds from the sale of part or all of those assets.
(6) The court has jurisdiction to appoint an ancillary receiver for the assets and business of a limited liability company. The ancillary receiver shall serve ancillary to a receiver located in another state if the court deems that circumstances exist requiring the appointment of such a receiver. The court may appoint a receiver for a foreign limited liability company even though a receiver has not been appointed elsewhere. The receivership shall be converted into an ancillary receivership if an order entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the other state provides for a receivership of the foreign limited liability company.
History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180.
605.0705 Decree of dissolution.—
(1) If, after a hearing, the court determines that one or more grounds for judicial dissolution described in s. 605.0702 exist, the court may enter a decree dissolving the limited liability company and specifying the effective date of the dissolution, and the clerk of the court shall deliver a certified copy of the decree to the department, which shall file the decree.
(2) After entering the decree of dissolution, the court shall direct the winding up and liquidation of the limited liability company’s activities and affairs in accordance with ss. 605.0709-605.0713, subject to subsection (3).
(3) In a proceeding for judicial dissolution, the court may require all creditors of the limited liability company to file with the clerk of the court or with the receiver, in a form as the court may prescribe, proofs under oath of their respective claims. If the court requires the filing of claims, the court shall fix a date, which may not be earlier than 4 months after the date of the order, as the last day for filing claims. The court shall prescribe the deadline for filing claims which shall be given to creditors and claimants. Before the date so fixed, the court may extend the time for the filing of claims by court order. Creditors and claimants failing to file proofs of claim on or before the date so fixed may be barred, by order of court, from participating in the distribution of the assets of the limited liability company. This section does not affect the enforceability of a recorded mortgage or lien or the perfected security interest or rights of a person in possession of real or personal property.
History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180.
605.0706 Election to purchase instead of dissolution.—
(1) In a proceeding initiated by a member of a limited liability company under s. 605.0702(1)(b), the company may elect, or, if it fails to elect, one or more other members may elect, to purchase the entire interest of the petitioner in the company at the fair value of the interest. An election pursuant to this section is irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.
(2) An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court within 90 days after the filing of the petition by the petitioning member under s. 605.0702(1)(b) or at such later time as the court may allow. If the election to purchase is filed, the company shall within 10 days thereafter give written notice to all members, other than the petitioning member. The notice must describe the interest in the company owned by each petitioning member and must advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase the petitioning member’s interest in accordance with this section. Members who wish to participate must file notice of their intention to join in the purchase within 30 days after the effective date of the notice. A member who has filed an election or notice of the intent to participate in the election to purchase thereby becomes a party to the proceeding and shall participate in the purchase in proportion to the ownership interest as of the date the first election was filed unless the members otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs. After an election to purchase has been filed by the limited liability company or one or more members, the proceeding under s. 605.0702(1)(b) may not be discontinued or settled, and the petitioning member may not sell or otherwise dispose of the interest of the petitioner in the company unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the company and the members, other than the petitioner, to authorize such discontinuance, settlement, sale, or other disposition or the sale is pursuant to a deadlock sale provision described in s. 605.0702(1)(b).
(3) If, within 60 days after the filing of the first election, the parties reach an agreement as to the fair value and terms of the purchase of the petitioner’s interest, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of the petitioner’s interest upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties, unless the petitioner’s interest has been acquired pursuant to a deadlock sale provision before the order.
(4) If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection (3), the court, upon application of a party, may stay the proceedings to dissolve under s. 605.0702(1)(b) and shall, whether or not the proceeding is stayed, determine the fair value of the petitioner’s interest as of the day before the date on which the petition was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.
(5) Upon determining the fair value of the petitioner’s interest in the company, unless the petitioner’s interest has been acquired pursuant to a deadlock sale provision before the order, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include: payment of the purchase price in installments, when necessary in the interests of equity; a provision for security to ensure payment of the purchase price and additional costs, fees, and expenses as may have been awarded; and, if the interest is to be purchased by members, the allocation of the interest among those members. In allocating the petitioner’s interest among holders of different classes or series of interests in the company, the court shall attempt to preserve any existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes or series insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of any specific class or classes or series may not participate in the purchase. Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable; however, if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning member to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, payment of interest is not allowed. If the court finds that the petitioning member had probable grounds for relief under s. 605.0702(1)(b), it may award expenses to the petitioning member, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and of experts employed by petitioner.
(6) The entry of an order under subsection (3) or subsection (5) shall be subject to subsection (8), and the order may not be entered unless the award is determined by the court to be allowed under subsection (8). In determining compliance with s. 605.0405, the court may rely on an affidavit from the limited liability company as to compliance with that section as of the measurement date. Upon entry of an order under subsection (3) or subsection (5), the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the limited liability company under s. 605.0702(1)(b), and the petitioning member shall no longer have rights or status as a member of the limited liability company except the right to receive the amounts awarded by the order of the court, which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment.
(7) The purchase ordered pursuant to subsection (5) shall be made within 10 days after the date the order becomes final.
(8) Any award pursuant to an order under subsection (3) or subsection (5), other than an award of fees and expenses pursuant to subsection (5), is subject to s. 605.0405. Unless otherwise provided in the court’s order, the effect of a distribution under s. 605.0405 shall be measured as of the date of the court’s order under subsection (3) or subsection (5).
History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180; s. 252, ch. 2019-90.
605.0707 Articles of dissolution; filing of articles of dissolution.—

(4) Upon the filing of the articles of dissolution, the limited liability company shall cease conducting its business and shall continue solely for the purpose of winding up its affairs in accordance with s. 605.0709, except for the purpose of lawsuits, other proceedings, and appropriate action as provided in this chapter.
History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180.
605.0708 Revocation of articles of dissolution.—
(1) A limited liability company that has dissolved as the result of an event described in s. 605.0701(1)-(3) and filed articles of dissolution with the department, but has not filed a statement of termination which has become effective, may revoke its dissolution at any time before 120 days after the effective date of its articles of dissolution.
(2) The revocation of the dissolution shall be authorized in the same manner as the dissolution was authorized.
(3) After the revocation of dissolution is authorized, the limited liability company shall deliver a statement of revocation of dissolution to the department for filing, together with a copy of its articles of dissolution, which must include the following:
(a) The name of the limited liability company.
(b) The effective date of the dissolution which was revoked.
(c) The date that the statement of revocation of dissolution was authorized.
(4) If there has been substantial compliance with subsection (3), the revocation of dissolution is effective when the department files the statement of revocation of dissolution.
(5) When the revocation of dissolution becomes effective:
(a) The company resumes carrying on its activities and affairs as if dissolution had never occurred;
(b) Subject to paragraph (c), a liability incurred by the company after the dissolution and before the revocation is effective is determined as if dissolution had never occurred; and
(c) The rights of a third party arising out of conduct in reliance on the dissolution before the third party knew or had notice of the revocation may not be adversely affected.
History.—s. 2, ch. 2013-180.
605.0709 Winding up.—
(1) A dissolved limited liability company shall wind up its activities and affairs and, except as otherwise provided in ss. 605.0708 and 605.0715, the company continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up.
(2) In winding up its activities and affairs, a limited liability company:
(a) Shall discharge or make provision for the company’s debts, obligations, and other liabilities as provided in ss. 605.0710-605.0713, settle and close the company’s activities and affairs, and marshal and distribute the assets of the company; and

(4) If the legal representative under subsection (3) declines or fails to wind up the company’s activities and affairs, a person may be appointed to do so by the consent of the transferees owning a majority of the rights to receive distributions as transferees at the time the consent is to be effective. A person appointed under this subsection has the powers of a sole manager under s. 605.0407(3) and is deemed to be a manager for the purposes of s. 605.0304(1).

(d) In connection with a proceeding under s. 605.0702 if a receiver, custodian, or another person has not already been appointed for that purpose under s. 605.0704.
(6) The person or persons appointed by a court under subsection (5) may also be designated trustees for or receivers of the company with the authority to take charge of the limited liability company’s property; to collect the debts and property due and belonging to the limited liability company; to prosecute and defend, in the name of the limited liability company, or otherwise, all such suits as may be necessary or proper for the purposes described above; to appoint an agent or agents under them; and to do all other acts that might be done by the limited liability company, if in being, which may be necessary for the final settlement of the unfinished activities and affairs of the limited liability company. The powers of the trustees or receivers may be continued as long as the court determines is necessary for the above purposes.

(3) A dissolved limited liability company or successor entity may reject, in whole or in part, a claim made by a claimant pursuant to this subsection by mailing notice of the rejection to the claimant within 90 days after receipt of the claim and, in all events, at least 150 days before the expiration of the 3-year period after the effective date of dissolution. A notice sent by the dissolved limited liability company or successor entity pursuant to this subsection must be accompanied by a copy of this section.
(4) A dissolved limited liability company or successor entity electing to follow the procedures described in subsections (2) and (3) shall also give notice of the dissolution of the limited liability company to persons who have known claims that are contingent upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of future events or otherwise conditional or unmatured and request that the persons present the claims in accordance with the terms of the notice. The notice must be in substantially the same form and sent in the same manner as described in subsection (2).
(5) A dissolved limited liability company or successor entity shall offer a claimant whose known claim is contingent, conditional, or unmatured such security as the limited liability company or entity determines is sufficient to provide compensation to the claimant if the claim matures. The dissolved limited liability company or successor entity shall deliver such offer to the claimant within 90 days after receipt of the claim and, in all events, at least 150 days before expiration of 3 years after the effective date of dissolution. If the claimant that is offered the security does not deliver in writing to the dissolved limited liability company or successor entity a notice rejecting the offer within 120 days after receipt of the offer for security, the claimant is deemed to have accepted such security as the sole source from which to satisfy his, her, or its claim against the limited liability company.
(6) A dissolved limited liability company or successor entity that gives notice in accordance with subsections (2) and (4) shall petition the circuit court in the applicable county to determine the amount and form of security that are sufficient to provide compensation to a claimant that has rejected the offer for security made pursuant to subsection (5).
(7) A dissolved limited liability company or successor entity that has given notice in accordance with subsection (2) shall petition the circuit court in the applicable county to determine the amount and form of security that will be sufficient to provide compensation to claimants whose claims are known to the limited liability company or successor entity but whose identities are unknown. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent all claimants whose identities are unknown in a proceeding brought under this subsection. The reasonable fees and expenses of the guardian, including all reasonable expert witness fees, shall be paid by the petitioner in the proceeding.
(8) The giving of notice or making of an offer pursuant to this section does not revive a claim then barred, extend an otherwise applicable statute of limitations, or constitute acknowledgment by the dissolved limited liability company or successor entity that a person to whom such notice is sent is a proper claimant, and does not operate as a waiver of a defense or counterclaim in respect of a claim asserted by a person to whom such notice is sent.
(9) A dissolved limited liability company or successor entity that followed the procedures described in subsections (2)-(7) must:
(a) Pay the claims admitted or made and not rejected in accordance with subsection (3);
(b) Post the security offered and not rejected pursuant to subsection (5);
(c) Post a security ordered by the circuit court in a proceeding under subsections (6) and (7); and
(d) Pay or make provision for all other known obligations of the limited liability company or the successor entity.
If there are sufficient funds, such claims or obligations must be paid in full, and a provision for payments must be made in full. If there are insufficient funds, the claims and obligations shall be paid or provided for according to their priority and, among claims of equal priority, ratably to the extent of funds that are legally available therefor. Remaining funds shall be distributed to the members and transferees of the dissolved limited liability company. However, the distribution may not be made before the expiration of 150 days after the date of the last notice of a rejection given pursuant to subsection (3). In the absence of actual fraud, the judgment of the managers of a dissolved manager-managed limited liability company or the members of a dissolved member-managed limited liability company, or other person or persons winding up the limited liability company or the governing persons of the successor entity, as to the provisions made for the payment of all obligations under paragraph (d), is conclusive.

(10) A dissolved limited liability company or successor entity that has not followed the procedures described in subsections (2) and (3) shall pay or make reasonable provision to pay all known claims and obligations, including all contingent, conditional, or unmatured claims known to the dissolved limited liability company or the successor entity and all claims that are known to the dissolved limited liability company or the successor entity but for which the identity of the claimant is unknown. If there are sufficient funds, the claims must be paid in full, and a provision made for payment must be made in full. If there are insufficient funds, the claims and obligations shall be paid or provided for according to their priority and, among claims of equal priority, ratably to the extent of funds that are legally available. Remaining funds shall be distributed to the members and transferees of the dissolved limited liability company.
(11) A member or transferee of a dissolved limited liability company to which the assets were distributed pursuant to subsection (9) or subsection (10) is not liable for a claim against the limited liability company in an amount in excess of the member’s or transferee’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the member or transferee, whichever is less.
(12) A member or transferee of a dissolved limited liability company to whom the assets were distributed pursuant to subsection (9) is not liable for a claim against the limited liability company, which claim is known to the limited liability company or successor entity and on which a proceeding is not begun before the expiration of 3 years after the effective date of dissolution.
(13) The aggregate liability of a person for claims against the dissolved limited liability company arising under this section or s. 605.0710 may not exceed the amount distributed to the person in dissolution.
(14) As used in this section and s. 605.0712, the term “successor entity” includes a trust, receivership, or other legal entity governed by the laws of this state to which the remaining assets and liabilities of a dissolved limited liability company are transferred and which exists solely for the purposes of prosecuting and defending suits by or against the dissolved limited liability company, thereby enabling the dissolved limited liability company to settle and close the activities and affairs of the dissolved limited liability company, to dispose of and convey the property of the dissolved limited liability company, to discharge the liabilities of the dissolved limited liability company, and to distribute to the dissolved limited liability company’s members or transferees any remaining assets, but not for the purpose of continuing the activities and affairs for which the dissolved limited liability company was organized.
(15) As used in this section and ss. 605.0712 and 605.0713, the term “applicable county” means the county in this state in which the limited liability company’s principal office is located or was located at the effective date of dissolution; if the company has, and at the effective date of dissolution had, no principal office in this state, then in the county in which the company has, or at the effective date of dissolution had, an office in this state; or if none in this state, then in the county in which the company’s registered office is or was last located.
(16) As used in this section, the term “known claim” or “claim” includes unliquidated claims, but does not include a contingent liability that has not matured so that there is no immediate right to bring suit or a claim based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution.

(1) If a limited liability company is named as or made a party in a derivative action, the company may appoint a special litigation committee to investigate the claims asserted in the derivative action and determine whether pursuing the action is in the best interest of the company. If the company appoints a special litigation committee, on motion, except for good cause shown, the court may stay any derivative action for the time reasonably necessary to permit the committee to make its investigation.

(5) After making a determination under subsection (4), a special litigation committee shall file or cause to be filed with the court a statement of its determination and its report supporting its determination and shall serve each party to the derivative action with a copy of the determination and report. Upon motion to enforce the determination of the special litigation committee, the court shall determine whether the members of the committee were disinterested and independent and whether the committee conducted its investigation and made its recommendation in good faith, independently, and with reasonable care, with the committee having the burden of proof. If the court finds that the members of the committee were disinterested and independent and that the committee acted in good faith, independently, and with reasonable care, the court may enforce the determination of the committee.

605.0903 Effect of a certificate of authority.—
(1) Unless the department determines that an application for a certificate of authority of a foreign limited liability company to transact business in this state does not comply with the filing requirements of this chapter, the department shall, upon payment of all filing fees, authorize the foreign limited liability company to transact business in this state and file the application for a certificate of authority.
(2) The filing by the department of an application for a certificate of authority means the foreign limited liability company that filed the application to transact business in this state has obtained a certificate of authority to transact business in this state and is authorized to transact business in this state, subject, however, to the right of the department to suspend or revoke the certificate of authority as provided in this chapter.

(3) A court may stay a proceeding commenced by a foreign limited liability company or its successor or assignee until it determines whether the foreign limited liability company or its successor requires a certificate of authority. If it so determines, the court may further stay the proceeding until the foreign limited liability company or its successor has obtained a certificate of authority to transact business in this state.
(4) The failure of a foreign limited liability company to have a certificate of authority to transact business in this state does not impair the validity of any contract, deed, mortgage, security interest, or act of the foreign limited liability company or prevent the foreign limited liability company from defending an action or proceeding in this state.
(5) A member or manager of a foreign limited liability company is not liable for the debts, obligations, or other liabilities of the foreign limited liability company solely because the foreign limited liability company transacted business in this state without a certificate of authority.
(6) If a foreign limited liability company transacts business in this state without a certificate of authority or cancels its certificate of authority, it appoints the department as its agent for service of process for rights of action arising out of the transaction of business in this state.
(7) A foreign limited liability company that transacts business in this state without obtaining a certificate of authority is liable to this state for the years or parts thereof during which it transacted business in this state without obtaining a certificate of authority in an amount equal to all fees and penalties that would have been imposed by this chapter upon the foreign limited liability company had it duly applied for and received a certificate of authority to transact business in this state as required under this chapter.

a. Employment, consulting, retirement, or similar benefits established separately and not as part, or in contemplation, of the appraisal event;
b. Employment, consulting, retirement, or similar benefits established in contemplation, or as part, of the appraisal event which are not more favorable than those existing before the appraisal event or, if more favorable, which have been approved by the limited liability company; or
c. In the case of a manager of the limited liability company who will, during or as the result of the appraisal event, become a manager, general partner, or director of the surviving or converted entity or one of its affiliates, those rights and benefits as a manager, general partner, or director which are provided on the same basis as those afforded by the surviving or converted entity generally to other managers, general partners, or directors of the surviving or converted entity or its affiliate.
(e) For the purposes of sub-subparagraph (d)1.a., the term “beneficial owner” means a person who, directly or indirectly, through a contract, arrangement, or understanding, other than a revocable proxy, has or shares the right to vote or to direct the voting of an interest in a limited liability company with respect to approval of the appraisal event; however, a member of a national securities exchange may not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of an interest in a limited liability company held directly or indirectly by it on behalf of another person solely because the member is the record holder of interests in the limited liability company if the member is precluded by the rules of such exchange from voting without instruction on contested matters or matters that may substantially affect the rights or privileges of the holders of the interests in the limited liability company to be voted. If two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of voting such interests, each member of the group formed thereby is deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership, as of the date of such agreement, of all voting interests in the limited liability company beneficially owned by a member or members of the group.
