## VACATING THE PROPERTY: Tag-teaming Disregard for Legal Obligations & Ethical Conduct:

This section meticulously dissects a series of egregious legal violations and ethical breaches stemming from the landlord-tenant relationship between you, Luther Rollins, acting through your Listing Agent Zach Steinberger, and myself, Stephen Boerner (with my spouse, Melissa Bemer). This is not a mere dispute over a security deposit; it is a comprehensive indictment of your deliberate disregard for Florida law, your blatant disregard for my safety and well-being, and your calculated attempts to evade accountability. The principal concerns are not isolated incidents, but rather a pattern of misconduct that includes:

1.  A calculated *Failure to Communicate Tenant’s PTSD and Related Security Issues*, demonstrating a callous indifference to my mental health and safety.
2.  A systematic *Noncompliance With Florida’s Abandoned Property Statutes*, revealing a blatant disregard for my property rights.
3.  A deliberate *Directive to Cease Communication and Potential Harassment*, showcasing a bad-faith attempt to obstruct my legal rights and create an atmosphere of intimidation.
4.  A reckless *Failure to Preserve Evidence and Potential Spoliation*, indicating a willful disregard for the integrity of the legal process.
5.  A calculated *Misrepresentation of Key Communications and the Two-Day Stay Past Lease End*, revealing a pattern of dishonesty and manipulation.

Under Florida law, both you, the landlord, and your agent bear statutory and ethical responsibilities to relay critical information—particularly regarding a tenant’s diagnosed PTSD arising from a break-in at the rented property. Additionally, Florida Statutes §§ 715.10–715.111 impose strict obligations on landlords to permit retrieval of personal property after lease termination. Your actions, and those of your agent, demonstrate a clear and willful disregard for these obligations.

**II. LISTING AGENT’S DUTIES & OBLIGATIONS: A Foundation of Betrayal**

**A. Duty to Communicate Critical Tenant Information (PTSD Disclosure): A Breach of Trust**

1.  *Legal and Ethical Obligation: A Mandate Ignored*
    *   Under Florida agency law and the National Association of Realtors (NAR) Code of Ethics, a listing agent is not merely a conduit for property transactions; they are obligated to act with utmost integrity and transparency. This includes a duty to promptly forward any material information disclosed by a tenant, particularly when it concerns health or safety issues. I informed Listing Agent Zach Steinberger that I had been diagnosed with PTSD following a March 26, 2024 break-in at the property—an event Zach was fully aware of due to his own text to Melissa and I on March 26, 2024 at 9:04:39 AM EDT, wherein he wrote:\

        “Hey all, I heard there was some commotion on the street last night. Some of the neighbors called me. Just wanted to check in and make sure everything is alright!”\

    *   Zach’s acknowledgment of the break-in highlights his firsthand awareness of the incident’s severity, which led to my PTSD diagnosis. Ignoring or withholding this crucial information from you, Luther, may constitute negligence or misrepresentation under Florida law and a clear violation of his ethical responsibilities. This is not a trivial error; it is a breach of the trust placed in him as an agent.

2.  *Knowledge Imputed to Landlord: No Escape from Responsibility*
    *   Agency law imputes the listing agent’s knowledge (e.g., my PTSD and the break-in details) to the landlord. You cannot disclaim responsibility by alleging that the agent failed to disclose material facts. This is not a loophole but a fundamental principle of agency law designed to prevent landlords from evading accountability. Your agent’s failures do not diminish your responsibility; they magnify it.

**B. Mandatory Forwarding of Personal Property Lists: A Statutory Imperative**

1.  *Florida Abandoned Property Statutes: A Clear Legal Mandate*
    *   Florida Statutes §§ 715.10–715.111 are not suggestions; they are legally binding requirements that obligate landlords to provide timely notice and a reasonable opportunity for a tenant to reclaim items left behind. If I provided an itemized list of belongings, Zach was legally bound to transmit it to you promptly. This is not a matter of convenience; it is a statutory imperative.
2.  *Consequences of Noncompliance: A Path to Liability*
    *   A willful or negligent failure to forward the personal property list can violate Florida law. Courts typically hold that a principal (the landlord) is bound by any notice an agent receives, claiming ignorance is invalid once the agent has the information. This is not a technicality but a fundamental principle of fairness and accountability. Your attempts to evade responsibility through your agent’s actions will not be tolerated.

**C. Agent Role Does Not Absolve Landlord: The Buck Stops With You**

*   *Principal-Agent Liability: The Landlord’s Ultimate Responsibility*
    *   Courts routinely interpret an agent’s failure to pass along critical tenant information—such as PTSD disclosures or property lists—as the landlord’s conduct. You, Luther, remain ultimately liable for ensuring compliance with Florida law and addressing security or health concerns a tenant raises. This is not a loophole; it is a direct line of accountability that you cannot escape.

**III. FACTUAL TIMELINE: 

**A. Text Messages to Zach on or Around September 2, 2024: A Written Record of Failing to Professional Ethics Requirements**

1.  *Reason for Staying Beyond Lease End: A Sequence of Unforeseen Events*
    *   The lease was set to end on August 31, 2024 (a Friday leading into Labor Day weekend). In a text to Zach on or around September 2, 2024, I explained I had remained on the premises for two extra days due to:
        1.  A large storm caused movers to cancel on August 31, disrupting my plans.
        2.  Having no assistance because my wife, Melissa Bemer, had left Florida a month earlier, leaving me to manage the move alone.
        3.  Losing alternative housing in Gulfport at the last minute on August 30th, 2024, as supported by the attached evidence, left me without short-term accommodations to transition into and out of after vacating 2649 Tifton St S, Gulfport, Florida 33711.
        4.  Experiencing a severe panic attack—connected to my diagnosed PTSD and the break-in—on August 31, which made it unsafe and impractical to vacate immediately, further compounding my distress.
    *   These were not excuses; however, they certainly should not be used as a justification to withhold my security deposit and personal property, nor to treat tenants with the disregard that you displayed.
2.  *Return of Keys & Property Condition: A Clear Record of Compliance*
    *   In this same conversation, Zach requested that I confirm the return of the property door keys to a lockbox at the front door. I complied and provided photographic or other evidence of vacating the premises on September 2, 2024, including car rental receipts and pictures of the vehicle used for moving. This is not a matter of conjecture; it is a documented fact.
3.  *Subsequent Visit on September 3, 2024: A Consequence of Your Inaction*
    *   I returned briefly around 11 p.m. on September 3, 2024, discovering leftover office chairs visible through a small garage window. This indicates confusion around property retrieval and potential incomplete communication about the retrieval process, as I had believed I might still have items in the garage. This was not an attempt to re-occupy; it was a direct consequence of your failure to provide clear instructions and a reasonable opportunity to retrieve my belongings.

**B. Disclosure of PTSD in the September 2 Text Exchange: A Callous Disregard for My Well-Being**

*   I formally reiterated my PTSD diagnosis in the September 2 communication, explaining that the home invasion on March 26, 2024—and your alleged inaction to address known security inadequacies (e.g., deteriorating side gate latches)—contributed to my mental health struggles. This further puts you on notice, via Zach, of my health concerns. This is not a minor detail; it is a critical piece of information that you and your agent deliberately ignored, demonstrating a callous disregard for my well-being.

**IV. DIRECTIVE TO CEASE COMMUNICATION & POTENTIAL HARASSMENT: A Pattern of Obstruction**

**A. Harassment and Bad Faith: A Deliberate Attempt to Silence Me**

*   *Cutting Off Communication: An Unlawful Act of Intimidation*
    *   If you instructed Zach or anyone else to stop responding to my messages—especially regarding abandoned property or PTSD-related concerns—such a directive can be construed as harassment or bad faith under Florida landlord-tenant law. This is not a mere inconvenience; it is a deliberate attempt to silence me and obstruct my legal rights.

**B. Violation of Abandoned Property Statutes: A Clear Breach of Your Legal Duty**

*   *Obligation to Cooperate: A Statutory Mandate You Ignored*
    *   Florida Statutes §§ 715.10–715.111 obligate landlords to coordinate retrieval and proper notice before disposing of or withholding property. Curtailing communication undermines these statutory obligations. This is not a suggestion; it is a legal requirement that you have deliberately violated.
*   *“Following Orders” Defense Fails: No Escape from Accountability*
    *   You, Luther, remain liable for Zach’s acts or omissions. An agent’s claim of “just following orders” does not negate legal responsibilities under Florida law. This is not a loophole; it is a principle of agency law that holds you accountable for the actions of those you employ.

**V. POTENTIAL CLAIMS & LIABILITY FOR AGENT AND LANDLORD: A Reckoning is Due**

**A. Agent’s Direct Liability: A Reckoning for Betrayal**

1.  *Negligence or Breach of Duty: A Failure of Professional Responsibility*
    *   Ignoring or omitting my PTSD disclosures or failing to communicate about property retrieval can expose Zach to liability for negligence, statutory noncompliance, and exacerbation of emotional harm. This is not a minor oversight; it is a profound breach of his professional duty.
2.  *Ethical & Licensure Violations: A Disgrace to the Profession*
    *   Both Florida real estate regulations and the NAR Code of Ethics prohibit concealment of material tenant information. Deliberate obstruction can lead to disciplinary action and potential license suspension or revocation. This is not a mere slap on the wrist; it is a potential end to his career.

**B. Landlord’s Overarching Responsibility: No Escape from Justice**

1.  *Principal-Agent Accountability: The Landlord’s Ultimate Liability*
    *   You, Luther, cannot evade liability by blaming Zach for any lapses. Courts typically hold principals fully responsible for their agents’ wrongdoing within the scope of authority. This is not a suggestion; it is a fundamental principle of law that you cannot ignore.
2.  *Damages: A Financial Reckoning for Your Actions*
    *   Failure to comply with abandoned property procedures can render you liable under Fla. Stat. § 715.109 for the greater of actual damages or three months’ rent. Emotional distress damages may also be recoverable if your (and Zach’s) conduct exacerbated my PTSD symptoms. This is not a mere possibility; it is a likely outcome of your deliberate disregard for the law.

**VI. PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE & COMMUNICATION RECORDS: A Demand for Transparency**

**A. Duty to Preserve All Relevant Records: A Legal Obligation You Cannot Evade**

*   From this point forward, you and Zach must preserve all communications—texts, emails, call logs—relating to the property, my PTSD, and any abandoned property lists. Under Florida law, destruction or alteration of relevant evidence after notice can result in severe sanctions (adverse inferences, monetary penalties, or default judgment). This is not a request; it is a legal mandate.

**B. Forensic Analysis & Cellular Provider Cooperation: A Pursuit of Truth**

*   Should it become necessary to determine whether messages were forwarded or deleted, a court may order a forensic examination of phones or email accounts and subpoena wireless carriers (e.g., Verizon). Tampering with records is an independent legal violation. This is not a threat; it is a promise of accountability.

**VII. DEMANDS & CLARIFICATIONS: A Call for Accountability**

1.  *Disclosure of Agent’s Communication: A Demand for Truth*
    *   *PTSD Disclosure:* Confirm in writing if and when Zach notified you of my PTSD diagnosis. If no disclosure occurred, explain the omission and what remedial steps you intend to take to address potential harm. This is not a request for information; it is a demand for accountability.
2.  *Receipt of Personal Property List: A Demand for Transparency*
    *   *Compliance with Fla. Stat. §§ 715.10–715.111:* Acknowledge whether you received from Zach, in early September at the time I was vacating the property, whether Zach provided, verbally or in writing, the forwarded context of my mental condition at that time as well as the itemized property list I provided informing Zach, and subsequently you, of personal property left behind. Given the nearly 30 line items of personal property in addendum b which outlines each one, I at this time included roughly 4-5 of the most precious and valuable of those items which included a commissioned and a 1 of 2 original art pieces I commissioned myself, a 55 inch tv, a brand new Weber grill, among several others. This implied great desire to work together to allow me the time legally allotted to retrieve the belongings. If there is any dispute, clarify possession and retrieval methods for remaining items (e.g., the office chairs observed on September 3). This is not a request for clarity; it is a demand for transparency.
3.  *Status of Communication Policy: A Demand for Clarity*
    *   *Future Coordination:* Confirm whether Zach (or another representative) is still authorized to speak with me about property retrieval. If a cease-contact directive remains in place, detail how you plan to fulfill legal obligations regarding personal property and statutory notices. This is not a request for information; it is a demand for compliance.
4.  *Commitment to Preserve Evidence: A Demand for Integrity*
    *   *Written Assurance:* Provide written assurance that neither you nor Zach will delete, alter, or move any relevant records regarding the break-in, my PTSD, or my property retrieval attempts. This is not a request for cooperation; it is a demand for adherence to the law.
5.  *Good-Faith Efforts to Resolve: A Demand for Action*
    *   *Immediate Clarification:* If you or Zach withheld my late-August and early-September texts referencing PTSD and property retrieval, an explanation is required. Furthermore, you must ensure the opportunity for any remaining property recovery and mitigate any harm caused by emotional distress or property loss. This is not a request for discussion; it is a demand for immediate action.

**VIII. CONCLUSION: A Reckoning is Inevitable**

The facts outlined—particularly the September 2, 2024 text exchange and my explicit reasons for staying two days beyond the lease, as well as the history of the March 26 break-in and resulting PTSD—demonstrate the significant legal exposure for both you and Zach. Under Florida law, a landlord’s agent is obliged to relay material information such as PTSD disclosures, property retrieval requests, and security concerns. Failing to communicate these details, or obstructing retrieval efforts, may give rise to substantial liability for statutory violations, negligence, and emotional distress.

To avoid further escalation, you are urged to respond in writing, confirm receipt of my disclosures, comply fully with Florida’s abandoned property statutes, preserve all relevant evidence, and coordinate in good faith to resolve outstanding matters. Failure to do so may subject you to legal action, including possible damages for the greater of actual losses or three months’ rent, emotional distress, and additional remedies under Florida law.

**Response to Luther Rollins (Landlord) Regarding Tenant Dispute**

Mr. Rollins, your inaction following the home invasion on March 26, 2024, has caused me severe emotional distress. Your failure to take any corrective steps, such as installing security cameras or making essential repairs, not only undermined my safety but also violated your obligations under Florida landlord-tenant law. This negligence left me feeling vulnerable and exacerbated my PTSD, highlighting the critical need for accountability in property management. Your subsequent mischaracterization of my text to you on September 4th, 2024, as an abandonment of property is not only a misrepresentation of facts, but a further insult to the distress and trauma you have caused. I wrote to you:
“Hi Luther, I'm leaving town tonight indefinitely. It's the only opportunity to get the other belongings off your hands and off your property. I understand however you want to handle this. And I thank you”
This was not an abandonment of property, but a notification of my departure and an attempt to coordinate the retrieval of my belongings.

Furthermore, it is critical to remind you and Zach, the realtor, of your respective responsibilities and consequences under the Florida Realtor Code of Ethics. You should have promptly addressed the concerns expressed in my communication sent around September 2nd regarding the ongoing issues. Whether or not Zach conveyed this information is a matter of serious concern. If he failed to do so, he may face significant repercussions, as tampering with communication records could be tantamount to obstructing justice. It is essential that both parties recognize the gravity of these omissions and the potential legal consequences that may arise from them.

The repercussions extend beyond mere inconvenience; they could severely impact both your and Zach’s professional integrity. Both of you are hereby advised to secure and preserve all communications related to this matter. Specifically, Zach must maintain texts and any verbal agreements made regarding my statements, particularly those concerning my PTSD and the inventory of valuable items I outlined in September. Any failure to do so may constitute a violation of the law, resulting in further legal action. The trail of missed communications and lack of transparency must be addressed with utmost seriousness to ensure accountability and restore trust. It is clear that this matter is not only about the breach of trust but about adhering to the legal standards set forth in our agreements.
