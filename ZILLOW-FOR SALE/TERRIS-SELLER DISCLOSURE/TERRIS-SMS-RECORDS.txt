Hi Stanley,
We handle quite a few of these transactions where the furniture remains with the property. Just to clarify, the furniture can't be included in the real property sale—it has to be handled separately, off the contract. Typically, we just leave it off the agreement altogether.

That said, the washer and dryer, refrigerator, oven, and dishwasher are considered part of the real property and will stay with the home.

In the meantime, I’ll start pulling permits to see what’s been done to the property, and I’ll also check public records to get a clearer picture of anything else going on with it.

We’ve also completed a comparative market analysis, and based on current market conditions, we believe the home should be valued between $530,000 and $540,000 as-is. This valuation reflects the house alone—the furniture is not factored into that estimate.

Let me know if you have any questions on how we’ll structure it or if you'd like to go over the comps together.
Best of wish for your test

Terris
