**IN THE SIMULATED JUDICIAL ANALYSIS OF PINELLAS COUNTY, FLORIDA**

**CASE NAME:** Boerner & Bemer v. Rollins & Polk
**DATE OF OPINION:** July 30, 2024
**COURT:** Pinellas County, Florida (Simulated Judicial Analysis)
**PRESIDING:** Judicial AI

**CASE SUMMARY**

This matter comes before this simulated judicial analysis concerning a dispute arising from a residential lease agreement for the property located at 2649 Tifton St. S. Gulfport, Florida. The Tenants, Stephen Boerner and Melissa Bemer (hereinafter "Tenants"), have asserted several claims against the Landlords, Luther J. Rollins, Jr. and Mary O. Polk (hereinafter "Landlords"). These claims pertain to the Landlords' handling of the security deposit, the habitability of the leased premises, the alleged unlawful withholding of personal property belonging to the Tenants, alleged misrepresentations concerning the identity and address of the landlord entity, and the conduct of the Landlords' designated agent, Mr. Zach Steinberger. The lease term commenced on October 31, 2023, and was originally set to expire on August 31, 2024, with a subsequent one-month extension through September 30, 2024.

**I. FACTUAL FINDINGS**

Based upon a review of the documents provided, the following facts are established:

1.  **FF001:** A residential lease agreement was executed for the property located at 2649 Tifton St. S. Gulfport, FL 33711. The initial term of the lease was from October 31, 2023, to August 31, 2024. This term was subsequently extended by one month, concluding on September 30, 2024.

2.  **FF002:** The parties to the lease agreement were identified as Landlords: Luther J. Rollins, Jr. and Mary O. Polk; and Tenants: Stephen Boerner and Melissa Bemer. (Evidence: Transaction Desk E-signature Detail with Authentisign-1747351866753)
3.  **FF003:** The agreed monthly rent was $4,500.00. Prior to occupancy, the Tenants paid a security deposit of $4,500.00 and a pet deposit of $500.00. The total move-in costs amounted to $14,000.00, which included the first month's rent, the last month's rent, the security deposit, and the pet deposit. (Evidence: Transaction Desk E-signature Detail with Authentisign-1747351866753)
4.  **FF004:** The lease agreement, on page 4, item 8, designated "Zach Steinberger" as the Landlord's Agent for the purpose of receiving notices. The address provided for said agent was "2649 Tifton St S," which is the address of the rental property itself. (Evidence: Transaction Desk E-signature Detail with Authentisign-1747351866753)
5.  **FF005:** An examination of the electronic signatures on the lease agreement reveals that the Authentisign ID for Landlord Luther J. Rollins, Jr. is identical to the Authentisign ID for Landlord Mary O. Polk (D0A56351-31E8-4772-BEE1-930046DC2DA9). Similarly, the Authentisign ID for Tenant Stephen Boerner is identical to the Authentisign ID for Tenant Melissa Bemer (0D2503F3-E571-EE11-9937-6045BDD47265). (Evidence: Transaction Desk E-signature Detail with Authentisign-1747351866753; STATEMENT-BOERNER-COMPASS CLAIMS-1747345893866)
6.  **FF006:** The Tenants were instructed to remit monthly rent payments for months two through eight of the lease term to "Amarlu Enterprises" at the address 231 Government Ave #3094, Hickory, NC 28602. The entity "Amarlu Enterprises" was not named as a party or otherwise identified within the executed lease agreement.

7.  **FF007:** Amarlu Enterprises, identified as a North Carolina entity associated with the Landlords, was not registered as a foreign limited liability company authorized to conduct business in the State of Florida during the tenancy period. (Evidence: PREFACE-1747340855643; new preface-1747340864574; TABLE OF CONTENTS & OPENING-1747351929077)
8.  **FF008:** On or about January 10, 2024, the Tenants notified Landlord Luther Rollins regarding a severely clogged kitchen sink. This condition persisted for a period exceeding 15 days without intervention or repair by the Landlords. The Tenants ultimately undertook measures to resolve the issue independently.

9.  **FF009:** A break-in occurred at the leased premises on March 26, 2024. Following this incident, the Tenants notified Landlord Rollins of the event and expressed ongoing concerns regarding the security of the property. Specifically, they requested repairs to the property's gates, which reportedly did not lock, and to the motion lights. They also sought permission to install security cameras.

10. **FF010:** In response to the Tenants' security concerns, Landlord Rollins approved the Tenants' installation of cameras, provided no drilling was involved. However, he did not commit to repairing the gates or providing cameras at the Landlords' expense, stating an intention to "check things" during a visit in April. (Evidence: Messages - 2024-12-04 01 01 39 - Luther Rollins-1747342076569; TEXT PROOF-LUTHER-CONCERN FOR SECURITY-3:28:2024-1747347471675)
11. **FF011:** Landlord Rollins conducted an on-site visit to the property on or about April 22, 2024. The Tenants assert that the previously reported safety issues, including the condition of the gates and motion lights, were observable by Landlord Rollins during this visit but remained unaddressed. During this visit, Landlord Rollins identified himself to the Tenants as a lawyer.

12. **FF012:** On April 24, 2024, the Tenants provided Landlord Rollins with a video recording (IMG_4273.MOV) demonstrating the malfunctioning motion lights. Landlord Rollins did not subsequently acknowledge or address this specific issue. (Evidence: Messages - 2024-12-04 01 01 39 - Luther Rollins-1747342076569; TEXT PROOF-LUTHER-MotionLights-4:26:24-1747347477958)
13. **FF013:** The Tenants vacated the leased premises on or about September 30, 2024, following the one-month extension of the lease term. (Evidence: Messages - 2024-12-04 01 01 39 - Luther Rollins-1747342076569)
14. **FF014:** On September 4, 2024, Tenant Stephen Boerner communicated via text message with Landlord Rollins regarding his intention to retrieve personal belongings from the property, stating he was "leaving town tonight indefinitely." On the same date, Realtor Zach Steinberger informed Tenant Boerner that Landlord Rollins had instructed him (Steinberger) to cease all communication with the Tenants concerning their personal property. (Evidence: MERGED TEXT PROOF-1747347459822; MASTER-ALL COMMS w:Zach-1747345131592; SELECT ZACH Messages - Zach Steinberger-1747345240098)
15. **FF015:** Landlord Rollins issued a letter dated November 8, 2024, which the Tenants reportedly received after they had already sent their dispute letter. In this November 8 letter, Landlord Rollins asserted a claim against the security deposit and proposed a settlement offer of $1,500.00 from the security deposit and an additional $500.00 for the Tenants' personal property. (Evidence: source_00-1747347212507)
16. **FF016:** The Tenants dispatched a letter disputing the Landlord's claim on the security deposit via certified mail on October 18, 2024. This mailing experienced delivery complications attributed to an incorrect ZIP code (28603 instead of the correct 28602) provided by the Landlord for the Hickory, NC address associated with Amarlu Enterprises.

17. **FF017:** The Tenants have asserted that the value of their personal property allegedly withheld by the Landlords is $4,200.00. (Evidence: VALUATION OF NON-ABANDONED PERSONAL PROPERTY-1747350478130)
18. **FF018:** A "Non-Lawyer Disclosure" form was executed by all parties, identifying Zach Steinberger as the licensee providing assistance. (Evidence: non-lawyer disclosure-1747346538171; Transaction Desk E-signature Detail with Authentisign-1747351866753)
19. **FF019:** The Tenants were not provided with a fully executed copy of the lease agreement—meaning a version containing signatures from both co-landlords, both co-tenants, and distinct Authentisign IDs for each signatory—until October 5, 2024. This was after the conclusion of the lease term and was provided only upon the Tenants' explicit request to Zach Steinberger.

**II. ISSUES PRESENTED**

The primary legal issues to be determined in this matter are as follows:

1.  **IP001:** Whether the Landlords complied with the statutory requirements of Florida Statute § 83.49 (2023) concerning the imposition of a claim upon, and the return of, the Tenants' security deposit.
2.  **IP002:** Whether the Landlords breached their statutory duty to maintain the leased premises in a habitable condition, as mandated by Florida Statute § 83.51 (2023), with specific regard to the reported clogged kitchen sink, the allegedly faulty motion lights, and the reportedly unsecured gates.
3.  **IP003:** Whether the Landlords unlawfully retained or otherwise improperly disposed of the Tenants' personal property, in contravention of Florida Statutes §§ 715.10 through 715.111 (2023).
4.  **IP004:** Whether the Landlords engaged in misrepresentation or failed to make statutorily required disclosures concerning the entity (Amarlu Enterprises) designated to receive rent payments and/or the Landlords' proper address for notice as required by the lease agreement and Florida law (e.g., Fla. Stat. § 83.50, § 605.0902 (2023)).
5.  **IP005:** Whether the Landlords' agent, Zach Steinberger, acted outside the permissible scope of his real estate license, engaged in conduct creating a conflict of interest, or otherwise engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.
6.  **IP006:** Whether identified irregularities in the electronic signature process (specifically, the use of overlapping or identical Authentisign IDs for distinct parties) and the delayed provision of a fully executed lease agreement impact the validity or enforceability of the lease or its terms.
7.  **IP007:** Whether the Landlords' communications and actions, particularly post-tenancy, rise to the level of harassment under Florida law.

**III. LEGAL ANALYSIS**

**A. Issue IP001: Compliance with Florida Statute § 83.49 (Security Deposit)**

*   **Reasoning (LA001):** Florida Statute § 83.49(3)(a) (2023) mandates that if a landlord intends to impose a claim on a security deposit, the landlord must notify the tenant in writing, by certified mail to the tenant's last known mailing address, of such intention within 30 days of the tenant vacating the premises. Failure to provide this notice within the 30-day period results in the landlord forfeiting the right to impose a claim upon the security deposit.
    The Tenants vacated the premises on or about September 30, 2024 (FF013). The Landlords' letter asserting a claim against the deposit and offering a settlement is dated November 8, 2024 (FF015). This date is more than 30 days after September 30, 2024. While this November 8th letter references a prior "Formal Tenant Response & Dispute" from the Tenants, indicating an earlier claim notice may have been sent by the Landlords, the timeliness and proper delivery of any such initial notice are critical. The Tenants' documented difficulty in sending their dispute letter due to an incorrect ZIP code provided by the Landlord for the Amarlu Enterprises address (FF016) raises concerns about the Landlords' adherence to proper notice procedures for their own communications. If the Landlords' initial notice of intent to claim the deposit was not sent via certified mail to the Tenants' correct last known address, or if it was not postmarked within 30 days of September 30, 2024, the Landlords have forfeited their right to retain any portion of the security deposit.
*   **Conclusion (LA001):** Based on the evidence presented, it is probable that the Landlords failed to comply with the strict notice requirements of Fla. Stat. § 83.49(3)(a). The November 8, 2024, letter is untimely. Unless the Landlords can provide definitive proof of a prior, timely, and properly delivered notice of claim via certified mail to the Tenants' last known correct address, they have forfeited their right to impose any claim on the $4,500.00 security deposit and the $500.00 pet deposit (if the pet deposit is treated as part of the security deposit under the lease terms).

**B. Issue IP002: Breach of Duty to Maintain Habitable Premises (Florida Statute § 83.51)**

*   **Reasoning (LA002):** Florida Statute § 83.51(1) (2023) imposes a duty upon landlords to, at all times during the tenancy, comply with the requirements of applicable building, housing, and health codes, and where there are no applicable codes, maintain the roofs, windows, doors, floors, steps, porches, exterior walls, foundations, and all other structural components in good repair and capable of resisting normal forces and loads, and maintain the plumbing in reasonable working condition. The landlord must also ensure screens are installed in a reasonable condition at the commencement of the tenancy and repair them once annually if necessary.
    1.  *Clogged Kitchen Sink:* The Tenants provided notice to Landlord Rollins on January 10, 2024, regarding a severely clogged kitchen sink (FF008). This condition, which persisted for over 15 days without repair by the Landlords and created unsanitary conditions, constitutes a failure to maintain the plumbing in reasonable working condition, thereby breaching Fla. Stat. § 83.51(1)(b).
    2.  *Faulty Motion Lights & Unsecured Gates:* Following the break-in on March 26, 2024, the Tenants notified the Landlord of faulty motion lights and deteriorating, non-locking gates (FF009). These conditions directly impact the safety and security of the premises. Despite Landlord Rollins' on-site visit in April 2024 where these issues were reportedly observable (FF011), and subsequent video evidence of the faulty lights provided by the Tenants (FF012), the Landlords failed to undertake adequate repairs. This failure to maintain the premises in a safe condition, particularly elements crucial for security, constitutes a breach of the general duty to maintain the premises under Fla. Stat. § 83.51(1).
*   **Conclusion (LA002):** The Landlords breached their statutory duty under Fla. Stat. § 83.51 by failing to timely and adequately address the clogged kitchen sink and the deficiencies related to the motion lights and unsecured gates, particularly after receiving notice from the Tenants and, in the case of the lights and gates, after a security incident had occurred.

**C. Issue IP003: Unlawful Withholding of Personal Property (Florida Statutes §§ 715.10-715.111)**

*   **Reasoning (LA003):** The Florida Disposition of Personal Property Landlord and Tenant Act (Fla. Stat. §§ 715.10-715.111 (2023)) outlines specific procedures a landlord must follow when a tenant vacates premises and leaves personal property behind. If the landlord reasonably believes the property has been abandoned, or if the tenant has surrendered possession, the landlord must give written notice to the tenant and any other person the landlord reasonably believes to be the owner of the property. This notice must describe the property, advise that it may be disposed of if not claimed, and specify the time and place for claiming it.
    On September 4, 2024, Tenant Boerner informed Landlord Rollins of his imminent departure and intent to retrieve belongings (FF014). Instead of facilitating this or following statutory notice procedures, the Landlord, through his agent Zach Steinberger, instructed Steinberger to cease communication regarding the items (FF014). The Landlord's subsequent letter of November 8, 2024, in which he states he "cannot confirm Or deny the presence of any specific alleged item of tenant personal property" and offers $500 for such property (FF015), further indicates a failure to comply with the statutory requirements for inventorying, storing, and providing proper notice regarding the Tenants' property.
*   **Conclusion (LA003):** The Landlords appear to have violated Florida Statutes §§ 715.10-715.111 by failing to adhere to the prescribed procedures for handling personal property left by the Tenants and by actively impeding its retrieval through their agent. The Tenants may be entitled to recover the value of the property, estimated at $4,200.00 (FF017), or actual damages.

**D. Issue IP004: Misrepresentation/Failure to Disclose (Landlord Entity and Address)**

*   **Reasoning (LA004):**
    1.  *Landlord's Address for Notices (Fla. Stat. § 83.50):* Florida Statute § 83.50(1) (2023) requires the landlord, or a person authorized to enter into a rental agreement on the landlord's behalf, to disclose in writing to the tenant at or before the commencement of the tenancy the name and address of the landlord or a person authorized to receive notices and demands in the landlord's behalf. The lease agreement designated Zach Steinberger as the Landlord's Agent for notices, but provided the rental property address (2649 Tifton St S) as the address for such notices (FF004). Using the tenant's own rental address as the official notice address for the landlord or their agent is problematic and potentially non-compliant if it does not represent a legitimate, independent address where the landlord or agent can reliably receive mail and legal process. It creates a circular and potentially obstructive notification pathway.
    2.  *Undisclosed Rent Recipient (Amarlu Enterprises) & Foreign LLC Registration (Fla. Stat. § 605.0902):* The Tenants were instructed to make rent payments to "Amarlu Enterprises" (FF006), an entity not mentioned in the lease agreement. This entity, owned by the Landlords, was not registered to transact business in Florida as a foreign LLC, as required by Fla. Stat. § 605.0902(1) (2023). While Fla. Stat. § 605.0904(2) states that the failure of a foreign LLC to obtain a certificate of authority does not impair the validity of its contracts or acts, § 605.0904(1) stipulates that such an LLC may not maintain a proceeding in any court in Florida until it obtains a certificate of authority. The direction of payments to an undisclosed, unregistered entity not party to the lease constitutes a significant lack of transparency and a misrepresentation of the party to whom rental obligations were being fulfilled. This conduct, coupled with the address issues for Amarlu Enterprises (FF016), suggests a pattern of obscuring the Landlords' business operations in Florida.
*   **Conclusion (LA004):** The Landlords likely failed to comply with the disclosure requirements of Fla. Stat. § 83.50 by providing a potentially ineffective or misleading address for notice. The instruction to pay rent to Amarlu Enterprises, an unregistered foreign LLC not identified in the lease, constitutes a material misrepresentation and a violation of Florida's LLC registration statutes. While this may not automatically void the lease for all purposes from the Tenants' perspective, it significantly prejudices the Landlords' ability to enforce the lease in Florida courts and supports a finding of bad faith.

**E. Issue IP005: Conduct of Landlord's Agent (Zach Steinberger)**

*   **Reasoning (LA005):** Mr. Zach Steinberger, as a licensed real estate professional in Florida, is bound by Chapter 475, Florida Statutes, and the ethical rules promulgated thereunder. The "Non-Lawyer Disclosure" form (FF018) explicitly states that he may not give legal advice. The Tenants allege that Mr. Steinberger offered a "professional opinion to not refund the security deposit" and acted as an unqualified damage assessor (STATEMENT-BOERNER-COMPASS CLAIMS-OCR.json). If Mr. Steinberger indeed provided such conclusive opinions on the legal disposition of the security deposit or made definitive assessments of damages beyond mere observation and reporting, he may have exceeded the scope of his license and engaged in the unauthorized practice of law or offered unqualified professional opinions. His role as both listing agent and the designated agent for landlord notices (FF004) also presents a dual agency situation that, while permissible with disclosure, requires a high degree of care to avoid conflicts of interest. His communication to Tenant Boerner on September 4, 2024, that he was instructed by Landlord Rollins to cease communication regarding the Tenants' personal property (FF014), directly implicates him in the Landlords' potential breach of their duties under Fla. Stat. §§ 715.10-715.111.
*   **Conclusion (LA005):** Mr. Steinberger may have acted outside the permissible scope of his real estate license if he provided unqualified opinions tantamount to legal or financial advice regarding the security deposit or damage assessments. His actions in ceasing communication about personal property at the Landlord's behest also expose him to scrutiny regarding his professional duties.

**F. Issue IP006: E-Signature Irregularities and Lease Provision**

*   **Reasoning (LA006):** The Florida Electronic Signature Act of 1996 (Fla. Stat. § 668.50) provides that electronic signatures have the same legal effect as manual signatures, provided certain conditions are met, including the ability to reliably attribute the signature to the person. The use of identical Authentisign IDs for different individuals (Landlords Rollins and Polk sharing one ID, and Tenants Boerner and Bemer sharing another) (FF005) is a significant deviation from standard e-signature protocols, which typically assign a unique identifier to each distinct signatory to ensure individual authentication and non-repudiation. This irregularity raises questions about the integrity and verifiability of the electronic execution of the lease. Furthermore, the failure to provide the Tenants with a fully executed copy of the lease agreement, complete with all parties' signatures and distinct authentication, until October 5, 2024 (after the lease term had ended and only upon request) (FF019) is a serious lapse in professional practice and transparency. Tenants are entitled to a copy of their executed lease at the commencement of the tenancy.
*   **Conclusion (LA006):** The e-signature irregularities cast doubt on the proper authentication of each individual party's assent to the lease terms. While occupancy and payment of rent may establish a tenancy, these procedural flaws, combined with the very late provision of the fully executed document, could weaken the Landlords' ability to strictly enforce all lease terms, particularly if challenged, and contribute to a finding of unprofessional conduct or bad faith.

**G. Issue IP007: Allegations of Harassment**

*   **Reasoning (LA007):** Florida Statute § 83.53(3) (2023) states that a landlord shall not abuse the right of access nor use it to harass the tenant. While this statute primarily addresses physical entry into the dwelling unit, the principle of prohibiting harassment can extend to patterns of communication. The Tenants have alleged harassment through repeated phone calls after requesting written communication (various documents including "Missed Calls and VM Transcripts-OCR.json"). Landlord Rollins' text message on October 29, 2024, stating he called "a couple times today to discuss the Tenant Response & Dispute" and expressing a hope to "resolve amicably" (TXT-HARASS-10-29-24-5.55PM-OCR.json), is, in isolation, an attempt at communication. To rise to the level of harassment, the conduct would typically need to be more egregious, persistent, and demonstrably intended to annoy, alarm, or intimidate, especially after clear requests to cease such specific forms of contact.
*   **Conclusion (LA007):** While the Landlord's preference for phone communication despite the Tenants' request for written correspondence in a dispute context is not ideal and may contribute to an atmosphere of pressure, the evidence provided in the excerpts does not conclusively establish a pattern of conduct that meets the legal threshold for harassment under Florida landlord-tenant law without further details on the frequency, nature, and context of all communications. However, a landlord's refusal to engage in a requested, reasonable form of communication (written) during a dispute can be indicative of bad faith.

**IV. LIABILITY DETERMINATION**

Based upon the foregoing analysis:

1.  **Landlords (Luther J. Rollins, Jr. & Mary O. Polk) are likely liable for:**
    *   Forfeiture of the right to impose a claim on the Tenants' security deposit due to non-compliance with the notice requirements of Fla. Stat. § 83.49(3)(a).
    *   Breach of the statutory duty to maintain the premises in a habitable and safe condition under Fla. Stat. § 83.51, specifically concerning the unresolved clogged kitchen sink, the faulty motion lights, and the unsecured gates.
    *   Unlawful withholding or improper handling of the Tenants' personal property in violation of Fla. Stat. §§ 715.10-715.111.
    *   Misrepresentation and failure to make proper disclosures as required by Fla. Stat. § 83.50 regarding the Landlord's address for notice, and by directing rent payments to an undisclosed and unregistered foreign LLC (Amarlu Enterprises), potentially violating Fla. Stat. § 605.0902 regarding the transaction of business by an unregistered foreign LLC.
    *   Potential bad faith in the overall handling of the tenancy and subsequent disputes, exacerbated by the e-signature irregularities and delayed provision of the fully executed lease.

2.  **Zach Steinberger (Landlord's Agent) is potentially liable for:**
    *   Acting outside the scope of his real estate license by offering opinions that may be construed as unauthorized legal or financial advice concerning the security deposit and property damage.
    *   Participating in and facilitating a lease execution process with significant e-signature irregularities and failing to ensure timely provision of a fully executed lease to the Tenants.
    *   Failing to ensure proper and effective landlord address disclosure for notice purposes within the lease agreement he prepared or facilitated.

3.  **Tenants (Stephen Boerner & Melissa Bemer) are:**
    *   Not found to be primarily liable for the core issues of this dispute based on the documents provided. Any claims by the Landlord for damages to the property beyond normal wear and tear would require substantial, credible evidence, which has not been sufficiently established in the provided excerpts.

**V. REMEDIES ORDERED**

Based on the Factual Findings and Legal Analysis:

1.  **R001 & R002:** The Landlords, Luther J. Rollins, Jr. and Mary O. Polk, are ordered to return to the Tenants, Stephen Boerner and Melissa Bemer, the full security deposit of $4,500.00 and the full pet deposit of $500.00, forthwith. This is due to the Landlords' likely forfeiture of their right to impose a claim under Fla. Stat. § 83.49(3)(a).
2.  **R003:** The Landlords are ordered to compensate the Tenants for the value of their unlawfully withheld personal property. The Tenants have valued this property at $4,200.00. This amount is awarded subject to any further proceedings should the Landlords contest this valuation with credible evidence.
3.  **R004:** The Tenants may be entitled to statutory damages or a partial rent abatement for the periods during which the habitability of the premises was compromised due to the Landlords' failure to maintain the premises (e.g., prolonged period with a clogged kitchen sink, unaddressed security concerns post-break-in) pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 83.56 and § 83.67. The precise calculation of such abatement or damages would require further evidence on the duration and severity of the impact on the Tenants' use and enjoyment of the premises.
4.  **R005:** Pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 83.48, the prevailing party in any formal litigation arising from this dispute shall be entitled to recover reasonable court costs and attorney's fees. Given the findings herein, the Tenants are likely to be the prevailing party on several key issues.

**VI. CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS (If Applicable)**

Should this matter proceed to formal litigation, the following points would require further clarification and evidence:

1.  **CQ001:** Definitive proof (e.g., certified mail receipt with tracking to the Tenants' last known correct address, dated postmark) from the Landlords regarding the date and method of delivery of their *initial* notice of intention to impose a claim on the security deposit, predating the Tenants' October 18, 2024 dispute letter.
2.  **CQ002:** Specific, itemized evidence from the Landlords substantiating any alleged damages to the property beyond normal wear and tear, including dated photographs taken immediately before Tenant occupancy and immediately after Tenant vacation, and invoices or estimates for repair or replacement.
3.  **CQ003:** A detailed account and any documentary evidence from the Landlords regarding the specific steps taken, if any, to comply with Fla. Stat. §§ 715.104-715.106 concerning the inventory, storage, and notice procedures for the Tenants' personal property after September 4, 2024.
4.  **CQ004:** The exact content, date, and method of delivery of the Landlord's communication to which the Tenants' October 18, 2024, dispute letter was a response.
5.  **CQ005:** Evidence from the Landlords demonstrating that Amarlu Enterprises was, in fact, registered as a foreign LLC authorized to conduct business in Florida at any point during the lease term (October 31, 2023 - September 30, 2024).
6.  **CQ006:** An explanation from the Landlords and/or their agent, Zach Steinberger, for the use of identical Authentisign IDs for different individual signatories on the lease agreement and the failure to provide a fully executed copy of the lease to the Tenants at the commencement of the tenancy.
