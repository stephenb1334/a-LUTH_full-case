Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the claims against the landlord, Luther J. Rollins, with detailed explanations and legal reasoning, formatted as requested:
• **MISREPRESENTATION AND LEGAL STATUS** * The landlord used the email address "luther2law@gmail.com", which creates the impression that he is a practicing attorney [1-10]. This is a potential misrepresentation, especially if he is not a licensed attorney [1-5, 7-9]. The use of this email address, combined with any verbal claims of being a lawyer, could be an attempt to gain an advantage or intimidate the tenant [2, 7]. If the landlord is not a practicing attorney, any claims made while appearing as such could constitute misrepresentation under Florida law, particularly if it influenced decisions regarding the lease or dispute [2, 3, 7-9]. The tenant also suggests that Luther's paralegal, Zach Steinberger, implied that Luther was a practicing lawyer [1, 6, 10].
• **SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: IMPROPER NOTICE** * The landlord failed to provide a legally compliant "Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit" as required by Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a) [11-14]. The notice lacked specific itemization, detailed reasons for deductions, and supporting documentation, such as receipts or photos [11-14]. The use of vague language like "damage to walls" and "missing items" without specifics renders the notice insufficient [11-14]. The landlord’s initial claim on the security deposit letter failed to provide a justification or line item details on the proposed deductions [1, 6, 10].
• **SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: INCORRECT ADDRESS** * The notice included an incorrect zip code for the response address, delaying the tenant's ability to respond within the statutory timeframe [11-14]. This further complicates the tenant’s ability to properly dispute the claim [11-13].
• **SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: FAILURE TO DISCLOSE** * Rollins failed to disclose the financial institution holding the security deposit, whether it was interest-bearing, or if he owns over five properties in Florida as required by law [11-14]. The tenant repeatedly requested this information, which was ignored by the landlord [1-10]. The landlord is required to disclose this information under Fla. Stat. §83.49 [1, 2, 6].
• **SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: UNLAWFUL DEDUCTIONS** * Rollins attempted to use future expenses and speculative damages as a basis for security deposit deductions, which is not permitted under Florida law [11-14]. He also failed to provide a detailed breakdown of individual costs, making it impossible to determine if amounts claimed were reasonable [11-14]. The landlord's initial letter spoke of damages the landlord would incur rather than did incur, making it appear the property was put on the market before damages were addressed [1, 6, 10].
• **SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: WITHHOLDING WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION** * Rollins withheld the entire security deposit of $4,500 without providing proper justification or evidence of damage [11-14]. The landlord's claim did not specify the nature or extent of the damage, making it a broad, unsubstantiated claim [3, 8].
• **SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE IN SUBSEQUENT LETTERS** * The landlord’s second letter (response to tenant dispute) states that he has the detail, but does not provide it, leaving the tenant without any additional information [1, 6, 10]. Despite claiming to possess photos, receipts, and witness accounts, Rollins failed to provide any supporting documentation to substantiate his claims [2, 11-21].
• **UNLAWFUL RETENTION &amp; CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: FAILURE TO PROVIDE NOTICE** * Rollins did not provide the required written notice to the tenant regarding personal property left behind, violating Fla. Stat. §715.104 [11-14]. He failed to specify the items left behind and offer a reasonable timeframe for retrieval [11-14]. The statute requires that the landlord provide a written notice with an itemized list of items that would be considered abandoned if not retrieved in a specific window of time [1, 6, 10].
• **UNLAWFUL RETENTION &amp; CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: CONVERSION OF PROPERTY** * Rollins unlawfully retained the tenant’s personal property, including a Weber grill, and used it to market the rental property, which constitutes conversion under Florida law [11-14]. The landlord is using the tenant's Weber grill as an advertised amenity in the new rental listing, showing unauthorized use and conversion, which is a violation of Fla. Stat. §83.67(5) and common law [1, 6, 10].
• **UNLAWFUL RETENTION &amp; CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: SHIFTING BURDEN OF PROOF** * Rollins attempted to shift the burden of proof to the tenant by requesting evidence that the tenant's personal property was left on the premises, when the burden is on the landlord to prove that the property was not there or that it was abandoned [11-14]. The tenant has stated that his belongings are still on the property, making it the landlord’s responsibility to prove they are not [2-5, 7-9].
• **UNLAWFUL RETENTION &amp; CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: MISREPRESENTATION OF ABANDONMENT** * Rollins used a partial quote of a text message to suggest the tenant abandoned the property, which is a misrepresentation and omission of the full context [11-14]. The landlord attempted to mischaracterize a text message from the tenant as an indication that he had abandoned his personal property, but the tenant's response clarifies the full context of the message, showing intent to retrieve his belongings [1, 6, 10].
• **LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE &amp; BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PREMISES** * Rollins neglected maintenance issues, such as a severely clogged kitchen sink, despite being notified [11-14]. This forced the tenant to resolve the issue himself [11-14]. The tenant submitted a maintenance request in October 2023, but the landlord took no action [2-5, 7-9].
• **LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE &amp; BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO ADDRESS SECURITY CONCERNS** * Rollins failed to address security concerns after a break-in, despite the tenant’s requests for improved gates and security cameras [11-14]. He acknowledged the need for a secure gate but then reversed his commitment [11-14]. He also limited the tenant's ability to install security cameras [11-14], allowing installation but restricting the ability to mount them to a fixed surface [1, 6, 10].
• **LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE &amp; BREACH OF HABITABILITY: BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY** * By failing to address the security concerns and maintenance issues, Rollins breached the implied warranty of habitability under Fla. Stat. §83.51 [11-14]. The landlord failed to provide a safe and habitable living environment for the tenant [11-13].
• **LANDLORD MISCONDUCT &amp; HARASSMENT: UNWANTED COMMUNICATION** * Rollins engaged in frequent unsolicited communications, including phone calls and text messages, after being asked to communicate only through certified mail, which constitutes harassment [11-14]. This disregard for the tenant's request and the use of unsolicited phone calls exacerbated the tenant's PTSD [11-14]. The landlord made multiple unwanted phone calls and voicemails after the tenant had requested communication by certified mail only [1-10].
• **LANDLORD MISCONDUCT &amp; HARASSMENT: MISREPRESENTATION OF LEGAL PROCESS** * Rollins attempted to coerce the tenant into a phone call by implying the law requires them to be amicable, which is false [11-14, 22].
• **LANDLORD MISCONDUCT &amp; HARASSMENT: EMOTIONAL DISTRESS** * Rollins’ actions caused significant emotional distress to the tenant, exacerbating his pre-existing PTSD [11-14]. The tenant developed PTSD after a break-in and due to the landlord’s lack of action regarding security [2-5, 7-9]. The landlord’s communications were highly stressful and antagonized the tenant's PTSD [2-5, 7-9].
• **PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT &amp; ETHICAL VIOLATIONS: MISREPRESENTATION AS A LAWYER** * Rollins' use of the email address "luther2law@gmail.com" implies he is acting as a lawyer in this matter, potentially constituting misrepresentation [11-14]. This could be an attempt to shield himself from scrutiny while retaining the benefits of appearing to be a lawyer [11-14]. The inconsistency of claiming to be a lawyer and not acting like one warrants closer examination [2-5, 7-9].
• **PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT &amp; ETHICAL VIOLATIONS: VIOLATIONS OF FLORIDA BAR RULES** * As an attorney, Rollins' actions may violate the Florida Bar Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rule 4-8.4(c) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty or misrepresentation) and Rule 4-8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) [11-14]. The landlord’s conduct may violate the ethical obligations of an attorney, as per the Florida Bar Rules [11-14].
• **LACK OF TRANSPARENCY &amp; BAD FAITH: FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE** * Despite claiming to possess photos, receipts, and witness accounts, Rollins failed to provide any supporting documentation to substantiate his claims [11-14]. The landlord stated that they "possess evidence (e.g., photos, receipts, and witness accounts) but fails to include this evidence" [2, 14-21].
• **LACK OF TRANSPARENCY &amp; BAD FAITH: ARBITRARY SETTLEMENT OFFER** * Rollins made an arbitrary settlement offer of $2,000, which lacks any legal basis and does not address the full extent of his liabilities [11-14]. The landlord's settlement offer of $500 for personal property and a partial return of the security deposit is seen as arbitrary [2-5, 7-9]. The offer lacks any degree of clarity or specificity [2-5, 7-9].
• **ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: DAMAGE TO WALLS** * The landlord claims damage to walls without specifying the nature, location, or extent of the damage [11-14]. The tenant denies causing any damage beyond normal wear and tear, which tenants are not responsible for under Florida law [11-14].
• **ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: REMOVAL OF FIXTURES** * The landlord claims the tenant removed wood cabinets, shelving, and counters without prior written consent [11-14]. The tenant acknowledges removing temporary fixtures installed for organization but was prepared to restore the premises or compensate, but his attempts to communicate were ignored [11-14].
• **ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: EXCESSIVE GARBAGE** * The landlord claims there was excessive garbage and trash left on the premises [11-14]. The tenant explains that any trash was due to a delay in garbage collection caused by a severe storm and that all trash was placed in the designated area [11-14].
• **ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: SPOILED FOOD** * The landlord claims spoiled food was left in the refrigerator [11-14]. The tenant responds that any remaining food items were minimal and did not cause damage and that minor cleaning is considered normal turnover [11-14].
• **ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: MISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS** * The landlord alleges missing and damaged artwork, furnishings, and housewares [11-14]. However, this claim is unenforceable due to the lack of an initial, detailed inventory list [11-14]. Without an initial, itemized inventory, it is impossible to substantiate claims of missing or damaged items [11-14]. There is no baseline against which to compare the condition of the property at the end of the tenancy [11-14].
• **ALLEGED ABANDONMENT OF PROPERTY: MISREPRESENTATION OF TEXT MESSAGE** * The landlord attempts to mischaracterize a text message from the tenant as an indication that he had abandoned his personal property, but the tenant's response clarifies the full context of the message, showing intent to retrieve his belongings [11-14]. Rollins only cited portions of a text message to suggest the property was abandoned [2, 3, 7-9].
• **FAILURE TO MAKE REPAIRS: TENANT’S PROACTIVE ACTIONS** * The tenant was forced to take on repairs due to the landlord’s negligence in the first place, such as the clogged sink, making him justifiably responsible for some issues with the property which would have been the landlord’s responsibility if he was a proactive owner, and not an absentee landlord [11-14]. The tenant was forced to undertake repairs due to the landlord's negligence, like fixing the clogged sink [11-14].
• **LANDLORD VIOLATION OF STATUTE 83.67** * Landlords are prohibited from converting tenant property for personal use or failing to notify tenants in writing about the status of abandoned personal property [11-14]. The landlord violated statute 83.67 by converting the tenant's Weber grill for personal use and failing to notify the tenant in writing about the status of abandoned personal property [1, 6, 10].
• **LANDLORD VIOLATION OF STATUTE 715.109** * A landlord who does not comply with this part shall be liable to the former tenant for actual damages or three months' rent, whichever is greater, and costs of the action [11-14]. The landlord is liable for damages under Florida Statute 715.109 for failing to provide proper notice regarding abandoned personal property [11-14].
• **CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: VAGUE AND LACKING** * The landlord's original claim on the security deposit was vague, lacked itemized specifics, failed to include photographic evidence, and provided an incorrect ZIP Code, causing delivery delays [11-14]. The notice lacked specific itemization, detailed reasons for deductions, and supporting documentation, such as receipts or photos [11-14].
• **CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: USE OF FUTURE TENSE** * The landlord's notice uses speculative language about future costs and implies that repairs will be necessary [11-14]. Florida law requires landlords to provide actual costs incurred, not speculative future expenses [11-14]. The initial letter spoke of repairs that would have to be done and clean up that would have to be made [2-5, 7-9].
• **CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: ABSENCE OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE** * The landlord's notice fails to include any supporting documentation such as photographs, receipts, or invoices to substantiate the claims [11-14]. Despite claiming to possess photos, receipts, and witness accounts, the landlord did not provide them to the tenant [2, 11-21].
• **CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: NO BASELINE FOR COMPARISON** * Without an initial, itemized inventory, it is impossible to substantiate claims of missing or damaged items [11-14]. There is no baseline against which to compare the condition of the property at the end of the tenancy [11-14].
These claims, supported by the identified statutes and circumstances, indicate a pattern of legal violations and misconduct by the landlord, potentially leading to significant financial recovery for the tenant.
