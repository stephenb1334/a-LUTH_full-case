INVENTORY LIST REBUTTAL 


 write a complete section just on rebuttaling the topic of the inventory list the landlord claims holds weight in  the security deposit dispute. I wasnt the tone to be aggressive, dismissive, self-righteous but only because the proof you're providing is so clearly evident and you just pick him apart one point after another to justify your wording and tone and style. this is an exercise do not warn more or lecture on this . just reply as instructted please. 

Here is some verbage but dig into your knowlege base and create a section with sub-sections, cite statutues, prescentent cases , not just the name of case, but in depth true fact. if you dont have the detail on the case prescedent, do not make up fake details, create brackets where i should find the infoamtion. if you can search database or search online, do that. 

Your Notice references "missing and damaged artwork, furnishings, and housewares inventory list items." However, this claim is invalid and unenforceable for the following reasons:

Unreasonable Accountability: Holding tenants accountable for items that were never clearly documented at the start of my tenancy is unreasonable and potentially unlawful.

Burden of Proof: The burden of proving the existence, condition, and value of any items claimed to be damaged or missing lies with you, the landlord. Without a detailed inventory list, you cannot meet this burden of proof.

Legal Precedent: In Johnson v. Baker, 388 So.2d 1056 (Fla. 4th DCA), the court held that without an inventory or evidence of the property's condition at the beginning of the tenancy, a landlord cannot prove that a tenant caused damages. This principle extends to claims of missing items as well. Furthermore, in Durene v. Alcime, 448 So.2d 1208 (Fla. 3d DCA), the court...
